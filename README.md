# UVA MSDS Capstone: Using speech to predict violent in value based groups

## Repository Structure

### The Data

The data in this repository is split into three different directories

1. Data: The "Data" directory contains the raw data, untouched data
straight from the source (usually a web source)
2. Data Preprocess: This directory is a transition directory where 
data undergoes various preprocessing steps including removing noise,
removing duplicate documents, and removing documents that are too short.
3. Data Clean: After the data has been preprocessed, a copy is created 
in the "Data Clean" directory. This is the data that is to be fed into
the models.
