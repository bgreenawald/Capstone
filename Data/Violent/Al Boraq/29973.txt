And the statement said that the American affairs expert said that the motives of war on Iraq is oil and oil then oil. And he showed that America has been unable so far to get the benefits of the oil because of the Iraqi resistance, so it transformed its plan to the other scenario which is enacting laws of selling all wealth, especially energy and water sources, and started to sell oil and gas by a law enacted for this purpose. A group of competent scientists and experts from Mujahedeen belong to Jihad and Reform front studied this law and showed its nullity, and that will be published later, Allah willing. The statement showed the nullity of this law and the contract that it contains, from the legitimate, political, economical and security sides.

And in the statement warning to all those who provide any kind of assistance, facility, signing or accepting this law as he will be a legitimate target for all mujahedeen in any time or place, regardless with who he is related. In the statement also a call to all honorable people in the nation to perform their duty towards Iraq, in which the fate of Iraq generations is being sold cheaply to Washington and that the military occupation may be soon ended, Allah willing, but the economical occupation will not be ended unless the wealth end. And another call is to the world nations, especially the American nation and the British nation to increase the grip on their presidents who play with the fate of nations when they promised them to achieve prosperity, bliss and freedom but then nothing is seen except lots their sons corpses and tens of thousands of wounded , and the beneficiary of this are oil traders like Bush and Cheney, and your situation toward the war criminals is the main factor which determines our situation and our nation's situation toward you. The statement calls all the tribes to disavowal and fight all who participate in passing this law,or shame will be on them if they kept silent. Finally, the front calls the Mujahideen in the statement to do their duty toward this law as the following : 1-targeting all brokers ,traitors and all who will participates in passing this law 2- Targeting all oil monopoly companies, and all who work in it no matter whoever it belongs 3- Targeting all export pipelines to cut the enemy artery and to differentiate between them and the internal transmission lines which serves the people of the country.
