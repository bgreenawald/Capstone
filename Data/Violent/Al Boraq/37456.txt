[Fight them, and Allah will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame, help you (to reach victory) over them, heal the breasts of Believers] In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful, [Fight them, and Allah will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame, help you (to reach victory) over them, heal the breasts of Believers] 9:14 Praise be to Allah, the Almighty Peace and Prayers be upon the Prophet, his Family and his Companions. Despite all that happens to our Nation from the disasters and wounds, it did not forget to celebrate the feast, so the Central Media Department of the Islamic Army in Iraq, devoted to show the joy by presenting the victory of the nation's sons, the Mujahideen, to be the first feast gift to our nation, and secondly to show the world our victories, and finally as a sympathetic message to the deceived people who don't know the truth about what happens to their sons in Iraq. Juba who follows the almighty orders [and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war)] insisted on spoiling the enemy's happiness with his death rumors, and sent to them his message through the third part of the Baghdad sniper video series. May Allah make all the Nation's days full with happiness and also for all the oppressed around the world.
