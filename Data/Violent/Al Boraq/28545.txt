1st of Shawal\ After long waiting, download the Eid gift for At-Tawheed people (Baghdad sniper part two). And slacken not in following up the enemy: If ye are suffering hardships, they are suffering similar hardships; but ye have Hope from Allah, while they have none. And Allah is full of knowledge and wisdom. (An-Nesaa,104) Allah helped your brothers in the media committee in the Islamic army in Iraq in finalizing the new release (Baghdad Sniper part two). We hope it gives pleasure to the Muslims as a nice gift on our Eid as well as it gives sadness to the infidels. We ask Allah near victory for our Muslim nation. The film shows a part of the sniper shot attacks in Baghdad this year which left 668 killed crusaders. We ask Allah to make it beneficial for all the Muslims. It is not ye who slew them; it was Allah: when thou threwest (a handful of dust), it was not thy act, but Allah's: in order that He might test the Believers by a gracious trial from Himself: for Allah is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things). (Al-Anfal,17) Praise be to Allah.
