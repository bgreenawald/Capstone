A statement regarding the occupation Praise be to Allah, the All- Strong, the All-Mighty. Peace and blessings be upon the prophet of guidance, the prophet of the great battle, all-Mighty on his family and all his companions. Everyday, the TV channels try to deceive people and propagandize the occupation, which made them, goals. Thus, we want to clarify the following issues: 1- The occupation and its tails play a dirty role to break the unity of the Mujahudeen and confuse people in order to keep their sight away of their casualties in Iraq. 2- Our system relies on fighting the occupation in its two types and whoever gives hand of help to them. Therefore nothing between us and them but the war until we achieve the victory- God willing. 3- In our fight against the occupation, we ask for help only from Allah first then from the Mujahideen and we donâ€™t need any help from anyone other than them. 4- Any personal action from any member of the Islamic army will not match with our religious beliefs is refused and this person will be judged in front of the religious court. 5- Our Jihadist military operations strongly continue in all districts against the occupation forces and their tails. Peace and blessings be upon the prophet, on his family and all his companions Ali Al- Noaimi The media tongue of the Islamic army in Iraq Tuesday, 12-6-2007
