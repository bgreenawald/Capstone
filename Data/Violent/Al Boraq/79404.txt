In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful, [Fight them, and Allah will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame, help you (to reach victory) over them, heal the breasts of Believers] 9:14 Praise be to Allah, the Almighty Peace and Prayers be upon the Prophet, his Family and his Companions. For four consecutive years Islamic Army in Iraq snipers exhilarates the eyes of the Muslims with Baghdad Sniper (Juba) while he shoots and kills the enemies of Allah under the hum of bullets mixed with the ‘Takberat of the Eid’ (Saying: Allah is Great). Oh God, give us the victory you promised to your worshipers ‘Mujahedeen’ (In Iraq and everywhere) oh allah, accepts those who were martyred oh allah, break the chain of their prisoners Amen
