The Islamic Army in Iraq follows with high interest what happens in the al-A'amiriya district, and we would like to emphasize the following: 1.Since the last incident, the Islamic Army in Iraq withdrew all of its members from the district, so anyone will talk using our name there will be a big lier. 2. In 13 JUMADA 1428 H, 29th June 2007, The religious department in the Army decided to terminate (Abu al-Abd) for violating the legitimate formal of the Army, and for his contempt the commands, the written decision was published and distributed to all partitions and therefore the group is not responsible of him and he will bear the consequences of his actions and who is with him. 3. We denounce any act targeting the innocent citizens, and one of our priorities is to preserve the lives and property of our nation sons. The Mujahideen military operations targets the occupiers and their agents and do not target the innocent people; supporting these innocents, guarding them, keeping injustice away from them and secure a decent life for them is one of the main goals of Jihad. 4. Anyone who will use the name of the Army, in the media or on the ground, and is not authorized by it, will bear the responsibility of ï€ that. Our Lord! in Thee do we trust, and to Thee do we turn in repentance: to Thee is (our) Final Goal Dr. Ali al-Naimi.
