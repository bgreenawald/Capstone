Assalaamu Alaykum I am new in this forum. I dont understand much of arabic so I am posting in english. In our country, people dont know much about what is actually going on in iraq. I have been spending lot of time and doing somer search and research on my own. I have lots of questions and suggestions regarding the situation and this forum layout. I would like to know if such input is appreciated/requierd or not. Partucularly, I would like to suggest that a forum section be made for general discussions such as new members, discussions on other issues which dont fit into iraq's category. Also, as I dont know arabic much, I have trouble figuring out which button means what as the text is in arabic. Is it possible to have a forum skin which is in english...? If it is possible, the members should also provide an english translation so that their message reaches more audience. It does not matter what quality of english translation any one can provide as some thing is better than nothing. --- Right now, I would like to get info about two less important things. I was reading analysis report from MEMRI institute, they mentioned about a special sniper film released by iraqi freedom fighters titled &quot;The 100 most beautiful sniper shots&quot;. Is this film available and where? Second, in around 2005-2006 we read in a local newspaper that american armies has ran short of pampers because of the fear of snipers... does any one has any details on this news? Jazakallaah
