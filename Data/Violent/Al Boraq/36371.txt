In the name of Allah, the most gracious, the most merciful &quot;Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord&quot; Praise be to Allah, and prayers on his apostle. Tears on the faces and sadness in the hearts, it is very hard to leave you but we will say only what pleases Allah We heard the news of martyrdom of our brother Abu Al-waleed, he was one of Iraq lions who answered the call of Jihad to defend the religion, he was fighter and media man in Al-Rashideen army. We can only say congratulations that he got one of the two great prizes which Allah promised us. We want to tell our brothers in Al Rashideen army that we ask Allah to give you the patient on your brother death and we ask Him to give you another lions instead of Abu Al-waleed. O' Allah accept him as a martyr and give him a place in your great paradise. The Media Committee The Islamic Army in Iraq 29/11/2007 www.iaisite.org
