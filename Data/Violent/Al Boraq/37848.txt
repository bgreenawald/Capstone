In the name of Allah the Most Gracious the Most Merciful Statement/ Release of prisoners ''But indeed if any do help and defend themselves after a wrong (done) to them, against such there is no cause of blame , The blame is only against those who oppress men and wrong-doing and insolently transgress beyond bounds through the land, defying right and justice: for such there will be a penalty grievous.'' After a call from our people and our brothers in Samarra and its districts, Mujahideen of the Islamic Army in Iraq launched a blessing attack in Samarra sector and could free ten prisoners (most of them were Mujahideen and the others were innocent poor people), they were captured before by al-Qaeda after raiding there strongholds in Sheikh Mohammed area in the South of Samarra. The attack was prepared and planned perversely, with the impact of information from the intelligence and field reconnaissance units, and Allah supported the Mujahedeen in achieving the desired objectives of this operation. Persons responsible of this jail were arrested while the rest managed to escape. We will post a full movie later. We ask Allah â€“the god of all creatures- not to make the Mujahideen enemies of each other. Praise be to Allah, prayers and peace be upon his messenger The military leadership The Islamic Army in Iraq Reform and Jihad Front
