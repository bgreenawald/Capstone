In the name of Allah the Most Gracious the Most Merciful Praise be to Allah, prayers and peace be upon his messenger prophet Mohammad, his family and all his companions 'Regarding Sheikh Mazhar al-Khirbeet' The leadership of Jihad and Reform Front heard about the intention of the Lebanese government to expel Sheikh Mazhar Thiab al-Khirbeet al-Delaimy who has been detained for more than 14 months in an arbitrary and fabricated way, and his only charge is resisting the occupation!! Such a decision means sentencing him to death especially if we know that the Sheikh has been suffering from chronic diseases and his health is deteriorating. This is a bad step comes from a country has a lot of recent problems and crisis; it is a contribution to serving the American and Iranian occupations. That happened in a time the Iraqi people was and still waiting for a hand of help and support from Lebanon not the reverse. Handing over a man from the resistance to the occupation against one of the Lebanese government wanted persons or whatever of other reasons can not be beneficial to the Lebanese people. Jihad and Reform Front denounces this unjustified action, and asks the Lebanese government to take the honest and justice positions towards the occupied Iraq and whoever resists the occupation from the people of Iraq and tribesmen. On this occasion, we call all countries of the region to fear Allah in Iraq and its people, and not to be involved in the American occupation crimes and carrying out its strategies -which target the entire region and all of its people- and not to arrest or expel those who resist the occupation and its supporters.
