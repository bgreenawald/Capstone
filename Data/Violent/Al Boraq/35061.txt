In the name of Allah the Most Gracious the Most Merciful Fight them! Allah will chastise them at your hands, and He will lay them low and give you victory over them, and He will heal the breasts of folk who are believers Praise be to Allah, prayers and peace be upon his messenger At the time our Jihadist operations against the occupation forces and their copmanions, death squads and Safawists militias increased, and at the time Jihad and Reform Front attracted more Jihadist groups and soldiers, we find that some people try to include our name in some refused projects which don't match with our Islamic Ideology and political program, therefore we would like to state the following: 1- The Islamic Army in Iraq confirms its previous attitudes that it hasn't any relations with the military formations associated with occupation and its tails, whether past or present, and our attitude towards it is unchanging recording to our Islamic Ideology and our general politics. 2- We respect the public interest of the Iraqi people in general and especially the Sunnis and work to achieve their interests and secure them recording to the Islamic rules, we do not target the innocent people as we know that one of the goals of Jihad is to support them, prevent injustice on them and keep them decent life. . 3- Our attitude towards the occupation forces and who support or assist them is unchangeable and our attacks against them are increasing, our military harvest indicates that in the last June our fighters launched 727 Jihadist operations which killed 524 of the occupation forces and the security companies members. . 4- We strongly alarm who wants to speak using our group name while he is not authorized to do that, whether in the media or on the ground, and he will bear the responsibility of this. Our Lord! Pour out constancy on us and make our steps firm: Help us against those that reject faith Dr. Ali al-Naimi The Islamic Army in Iraq media spokesman 11 Rajab 1428 H 25 July 2007 www.iaisite.org
