In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Fight them! Allah will chastise them at your hands, and He will lay them low and give you victory over them, and He will heal the breasts of folk who are believers Praise be to Allah, the All- Strong, the All-Mighty. Peace and blessings be upon the prophet of guidance, the prophet of the great battle, all-Mighty on his family and all his companions Allah said (Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies, of Allah and your enemies) And said (It is not ye who slew them; it was Allah: when thou threwest (a handful of dust), it was not thy act, but Allah's) Uqbah ibn `Amir said, "I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) saying while he was on the pulpit, 'In the verse, [And make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds of war], the word power means archery the word force means archery.'" Sahih Muslim And The Prophet said, "O children of Ishmael! Practice archery as your father Ishmael was a great archer" Sahih Al-Bukhari `Uqbah also said, "I heard Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) saying, 'Allah will cause three persons to enter Paradise for one arrow: the maker when he has a good intention in making it, the one who shoots it, and the one who hands it. '" Sunan Ibn Majah Your brothers in the Islamic army in Iraq have good news for you that the developing and manufacturing division in the army- by the help of Allah-could manufacture an earth-earth rocket with 20 km range of long and with head weight of 20 kilogram. We called it Abeer as a reminder of what happened in Mahmoodiya to our sister in Islam Abeer, who was raped by the crusaders and was killed after that. In the time we bring good news to our Muslim brothers, we promise the crusaders that they will find the feeling of death by these Abeer rockets, which will burn them and make victory for the Muslims. This rocket is only one of many rockets and weapons they will suffer from. We ask every real Muslim to Pray that Allah help us because the situation in Iraq is very hard and complex. Finally, we ask Allah to make our intentions and deeds pure and give us victory upon his enemies. He is the most strong and his help is only what we need.
