A spokesman for Krap King, Inc. said the company would have the new &quot;Islamoflusher&quot; model in stores for the spring, when Americans do their most flushing – sacred religious texts included. The new toilet would &quot;help prevent and possibly eliminate&quot; situations like the recent Newsweek story, which reported that American interrogators at Guantanamo Bay flushed a Koran down the toilet to &quot;intimidate&quot; suspected terrorists. &quot;The toilet backed up when the Koran clogged it,&quot; said an anonymous Krap King employee. &quot;A detainee witnessed the whole thing, and...BAM! Next thing you know, there's 17 dead and hundreds injured during anti-American rioting. Our toilet will prevent such incidents. If an interrogator puts a Koran in, that sucker ain't coming back up.&quot; Newsweek has since retracted the story, but Krap King is proceeding nonetheless. &quot;Preventative measures,&quot; said an anonymous employee. &quot;Plus, this is the toilet industry's big chance to shed its aura of obscurity and really make a splash.&quot; The ACLU released a statement denouncing the toilet. &quot;This toilet shall accommodate Talmuds and Bibles,&quot; the statement read. &quot;And we're checking into sacred Hindu and Buddhist texts, too. We will not have the toilet industry marketing their product for the sole purpose of humiliating Muslims.&quot; &quot;We've gone after Big Tobacco and Big Oil before,&quot; the statement continued. &quot;There's no reason why we won't confront Big Toilets on this issue.&quot; &quot;If Krap King can make an extra buck by being able to flush all the major religious books,&quot; said another employee, &quot;get ready for our Atheist 4000 model.&quot; __________________ الإسلام يفرض سياستنا وليست السياسة التي تفرض كيف يكون إسلامنا
