In the name of Allah, the most gracious, the most merciful. &quot;Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the presence of their Lord;&quot; (3,169) Praise be to Allah, the All- Strong, the All-Mighty. Peace and blessings be upon the prophet of guidance, the prophet of the great battle, all-Mighty on his family and all his companions. Martyrs have great and high position in Islam. Allah set the degree of the Mujahideen higher that those who didn't go for Jihad, more higher are the martyrs who had provided their life and wealth for the sake of Allah. Allah said: &quot;Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Qur'an: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme&quot; (9,111). The Mujahideen walk on the same way of Salaf- May Allah makes them satisfied. It is the same way which Prophet Mohammed and the prophets before him had walked on. The martyrs have seven merits from Allah as prophet Mohammed-prayers and peace be upon him- said: (“The martyr (shaheed) has seven blessings from Allah: he is forgiven from the moment his blood is first shed; he will be shown his place in paradise; he will be spared the trial of the grave; and he will be secure on the day of the Greatest Terror (the Day of Judgment); there will be placed on his head a crown of dignity, one ruby of which is better than this world and all that is in it; he will be married to seventy-two of al-hoor al-‘iyn; and he will be permitted to intercede for seventy of his relatives.” To keep our martyrs in memory forever, your brothers in the Islamic Army in Iraq produced- by help of Allah- the special release (Men who have been true to their covenant). A collection of short biographies of the martyrs was attached with the release. Praise be to Allah.
