In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Fight them! Allah will chastise them at your hands, and He will lay them low and give you victory over them, and He will heal the breasts of folk who are believers Praise be to Allah, the All- Strong, the All-Mighty. Peace and blessings be upon the prophet of guidance, the prophet of the great battle, all-Mighty on his family and all his companions It is giving pleasure that the Media committee in the Islamic Army in Iraq wants to introduce its viewed Nasheed (O’ Baghdad sniper, don’t give up), we ask Allah to make it a reason of happiness to the patient Mujahudeen and a reason of sadness to his enemies of the infidels and hypocrites. We ask Allah to give our Muslim nation the near victory and survival. O’ Allah make us united and our word one word and give us victory upon your enemies.
