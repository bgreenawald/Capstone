http://x7.to/2cucy5 http://x7.to/q1qeuo The Central Media Department The Islamic Army In Iraq 9-4-2011 ****Transcript of the Speech given in the release**** Persistence Dear beloved brothers, The road ahead my brothers is long, the road that drained out Adam, that Nouah mourned for, that Ibrahim was thrown in the fire for, that Ismail was laid down to be slaughtered for, that Zakaria published in the publishings for, that Isa walked with the beasts for, that Ayub healed the blind and lived through all this the prophet peace be upon him. we are the ones that say we pledge our allegiance to this religion, Muhammad as long as we stay. Brothers of faith and believe… Our fight and road is a long road ahead that must be carried out, the one who walks this road must have the Faith of Muhammad and must have the ideology of Islam that the prophet peace be upon him brought up his companions on until they concurred the regions from country to country. As for us today, our road and our cause is deeper and wider than that matter, some might say why?…. Because the fight today is a harder fight may be yesterday or before they were fighting with swords that they would waiver but today rockets are being pointed at us from everywhere. The enemy has turned against us our families and brothers from everywhere, the enemy has become enemies; a malicious crusader enemy and a vile nasty safawy enemy. For this reason the tactics and strategies of this battle we must surround the enemy from all around. You have in the Battle of Al Ahzab a fine example for what the prophet peace be upon him did, fighting the non believers until he overwhelmed them, until he told them he is the prophet who came to kill you so when the malicious Jewish hears this, that Muhammad has rounded up an army and he says he ha come to kill you he (the enemy) faints on the ground. When Ali may Allah be pleased with him was asked, how do you shock your enemy O' Ali he says (may Allah be pleased with him) I use against him two things, when I come to him and hold the sword with my right hand he is certain that I will kill him and when I start and launch my sword on his neck he knows that I will kill him so he seeks the help of myself and his against him than he is killed and dies. As for us today we know for certain that Allah will give us victory, that Allah will console us and that Allah will fail the plans of the non believers. We must therefore become aware of our cause because our cause is a difficult cause which can not be hidden from anyone. As the pictures in the media show to you the armies and the armed groups of horror and a Muslim must be aware of the armies that fight today. As for us in the group of The Islamic Army who Allah the Almighty has used on this earth to fight against these enemies and these armies, we must realise the truth about our matter because we live in harsh circumstances that almost all people can not understand. We do not want to have an armed image only but we must carry the ideology of Muhammad peace be upon him in our hearts. - poetic lines- we must be aware that our cause has fear from Allah when it comes to blood because blood is not cheap for Muslims. Know my brother that the first thing that will be accountable for between mankind is blood so we must investigate every muslim blood and you must know that you are accountable; for every move that you make, every word that you say, and that this bullet which came to you after much hindrance and pain we do not want it to be shot in the air. Because you must take into account that this bullet that leaves the kalashnikov that you own or others must concentrate its full concentration on hitting the target and not to be shot before the target and before you hit it, No, you may have found it today (the bullet) but tomorrow you may not find it. Today if you concentrate on this weapon and look after it and work hard on it so that it can be in good condition may be you will not find it tomorrow. May be today that Allah the Almighty allowed us to sit in this blessed gathering in the land of Allah in full control and without pity from the non believers may be the Almighty may not let us meet with you tomorrow because today we come to realise that the most dangerous times that we come across are these times and that the days of relief is coming. - poetic lines- On the day of judgment or in the hereafter you are put in front of your lord the Almighty, than all mankind are brought in some of whom their actions are between their hands than comes the martyr, when the people are barefoot, nude and uncircumcised than all mankind stand in front of their lord the Almighty than comes the martyr on the day of judgment carrying his sword or his rifle or BKC or RPG on his shoulder he will split the lines and I swear if the one who comes with blood on his hands says to Ibrahim the beloved of the Almighty step aside from me he will step aside and let him sit on a platform full of light under the throne of the almighty than he looks at how he veered between mankind. for the one who asks and says who gains this status? we say it is the martyr…. the martyr who spends himself and his money in the way of Allah to lift the banner of Allah the Almighty on earth in empowerment, justice and kindness. we must dear brother know our cause the Islamic nation is Islamic, the Jewish today have started to know their Jewishness, the crusaders know their Christianity, the Buddhist knows his Buddhism but the Muslim today is ignorant about Islam because of the scholars who worship the Dirham and Dinar those who lose out on martyrdom and make the youth of this nation lose out. Beware my Muslim brother not to deal with non Muslim fighter, who fights for the sake of Allah the true jihad, how many fighters say they fight for the sake of Allah but in this battle field only the true, patient and those who lay waiting to ambush persist. How many fighters did we see for two or three days who we do not see amongst you today, how many fighters did we hear yesterday and before talk about Jihad and fighting we do not see amongst you. Persistence is persistence in religion and ideology, Allah the Almighty makes those who believe persist by saying persistent words in this world and the hereafter. In terms of this world it is a type of persistence.. although persistence will be long, although the matter will be long… although the agony will be long may be we say to you we have not become martyrs until now, we have not been split up till now, our hands and feet have not been cut till now, the saw has not been put on our heads and pulled through until now, we do not want an alarm, we do not want to deny the truth. No Muslim brother we must realise that fighting is disliked in human nature for Allah the Almighty says {Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.} Do not be seduced by this world because the prophet peace be upon him when he died there was nothing left in his house but four Dirhams but the prophet woke up from his unconscious state and said O' Aisha where are the 4 Dirhams, she said they are present oh prophet of Allah, he said spend it O' Aisha. No by the one who there is no one but him we must realise that this world will come to an end with everything in it and that the hereafter is the permanent place of stay but do we die like the fools die? do we die like the rest of the people die? do we die like the corpses die? we must be aware that the martyr is alive in his grave, we must be aware that fighting is obligatory on this nation, no justice of a just or unfairness of a neighbor, the matter is great and the battle will be long. O' Allah give victory to the Mujahdeen O' Allah support the Mujahdeen with your victory and your goodness O' generous one O' Allah hit on target their shooting O' Allah shake the ground under their enemy O' Allah make what we throw at them stones of baked clay, and make what they throw at us thou and cool O' Allah hurry for for us martyrdom for your sake O' Allah hurry for for us martyrdom for your sake O' Allah hurry for for us martyrdom for your sake O' Allah Cover our faults and calm our fears safe O' Allah Cover our faults and calm our fears safe O' Allah Cover our faults and calm our fears safe O' Allah protect our dignity and the dignity of Muslims from all bad things O' Allah make your control through us O' Allah take from our blood until you are satisfied O' Allah take from our blood until you are satisfied O' Allah take from our blood until you are satisfied Amen Amen peace be upon our prophet Muhammad and his companions ******* END ******* Source: www.iaisite-eng.org
