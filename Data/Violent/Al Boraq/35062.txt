Jihad and Reform Front/ Jamma' Salafia Leldawa Walqital group joins the Front and the Front welcomes them In the name of Allah the Most Gracious the Most Merciful Truly Allah loves those who fight in His Cause in battle array, as if they were a solid cemented structure. Praise be to Allah, prayers and peace be upon his messenger. After our brothers who are the leaders of Jamma' Salafia Leldawa Walqital group revised and discussed the Front ideologies with its leaders, The leadership of the group decided to join this blessed Front and to commit to the following: 1. The general, legal and formal laws. 2. The general policies. 3. The political program. 3. The attitude towards the major events. 4. Military Operations and statements. At the time we congratulate this joining, which comes as a response to the principles of our religion which call for the unity of the Muslims forces and lines away from the factionalism, isolation and exclusion of the other opinion, we call the rest of the groups to this unity, which makes happiness to the friend and enrages the enemy. It is like a thorn in the body of the Crusaders, the Safawists and who support them over the Muslims. We ask Allah to give us victory over our enemies and lead us to the right path and keep us on it. We ask Him to keep us away from evil way. O' Allah help us and strengthen our hearts until we achieve victory. He is the most power to do it.
