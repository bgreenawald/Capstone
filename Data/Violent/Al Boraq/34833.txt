In the name of Allah the Most Gracious the Most Merciful Praise be to Allah, prayers and peace be upon his messenger Jihad and Reform Front monitor with great concern what is going on our beloved North, thou Iraq has become an open arena for each player, and a fertility ground for all invaders, and a scene for serious events, and secure shelter for every devil, and the agreement of war criminals on dividing Iraq became imminent, to make it a better place to liquidate the external consideration on its territory. At the time Sunnis are being displaced from their towns and killed in center and south Iraq, visas and residence cards is being imposed against them in the north with unfairly and harsh conditions, and in the same time it is a haven for the Kurdish Workers Party, which attacks Turkey, and then to start the new scene of a Turkish military intervention. On this occasion we: 1- We ask the Turkish government to try all the political and diplomatic ways to resolve the crisis before starting any military operation which will harm innocent civilians among our miserable Kurdish people . 2- We confirm on the unity of Iraq (land and people), and we hold the occupation, the government and the Kurdish leadership the responsibility for what is happening in our beloved North. 3- We call on our Kurdish people to adhere on the legitimate solutions as a Muslim people and not be a mean used to divide Iraq or damaging it. We pray to Allah to preserve Muslims and prevent killing between them.
