Nakba- The Palestinian Catastrophe 02/12/06 08:22 AM Open this Placemark (2732 downloads) Edit Reply Quote Quick Reply Hello This is a grand post. I have spent the last few days assimilating this database. For those interested in history, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the Middle East, human rights, or refugees , this place mark may be of interest to them. In the aftermath of the 1948 war between the Arabs and the Israelis, 800,000 Palestinians were deported, or fled, their native villages in Palestine where they lived for thousands of years. They became refuges since then. Their villages, around 700 of them, were subsequently destroyed totally or partially. The issue of these refuges and their right to their native land remains the major obstacle to achieve a long desired peace between the Israelis and Palestinians in the Middle East's long and bitter conflict. The post contains the following 1.Map of the districts of Palestine at 1948. 2.A list of the hundreds of destroyed Arab villages, classified by district. With links to websites that give further more detailed information about the particular village or town. 3.A list of the existing Arab villages and towns in the 1948 area and the 1967 area. It has been a tedious work since I did not find the coordinates of the destroyed villages in one place. So I had to collect them from here and there. Please email me for any corrections of coordinates or any updates. &lt;*********************&gt; Thameen Darby --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lifta- A partially destroyed village in the Jerusalem district. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Some Palestinians leaving their village in 1948. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- A refugee girl tending to her sick grandfather.
