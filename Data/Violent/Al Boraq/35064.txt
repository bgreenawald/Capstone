Otherwise, he will bear the responsibility of slander us and the consequences of his speech. 5- We assure to our people and our Islamic nation that Allah victory promise, empowerment of the Mujahideen and defeat and shame of the occupiers and their henchmen is, by Allah willing, became very near, but victory is patience of an hour so be patient and strong and fear Allah.
