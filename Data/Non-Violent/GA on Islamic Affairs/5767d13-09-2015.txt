HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf chairman, said that Friday prayer Imams throughout the UAE mosques were instructed to perform the absentee funeral prayer (Salat Alghayeb) upon the souls of the righteous martyrs of the nation following the orders of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President.
Dr Al Kaabi explained that the theme of this Friday's sermon would be on the martyrs of the nation and their honourable status and would stress the UAE people's support to their leadership, the Armed Forces and families of the martyrs. The sermon will further include supplications and prayers for the martyrs, imploring to Allah to gather them with the steadfast affirmers of truth people, the martyrs and the righteous, said Dr Al Kaabi.
