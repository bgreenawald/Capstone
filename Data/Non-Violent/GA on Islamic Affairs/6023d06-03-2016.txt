HH Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Mohammed Al Nahyan, the Ruler's Representative in the Eastern Region, has inaugurated Awqaf's new branch in the central area of the administrative centre in Al Ain City. The new building constitutes a landmark that features the distinctive Islamic architecture and an addition to the urban fabric of the nearby government buildings.
Emphasising the prudent leadership's interest in all that promotes Awqaf's mission in the society, HH Sheikh Tahnoon said the building would receive the appreciation of all people. "Building more mosques is a priority for the UAE wise leadership and is given utmost attention following the architectural and civilisational excellence witnessed all over the UAE," Sheikh Tahnoon added.
For his part, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, said this civilised addition to Al Ain City is the fruit of the continuous support and the kind stewardship of HH Sheikh Hazza Bin Tahnoun to Awqaf's projects in the Eastern Region, noting that "more outstanding projects are in the pipeline, Allah willing".
"This building reflects Awqaf's identity, thanks to its distinctive Islamic style. With the wise leadership's great support, Awqaf is planning to construct buildings with the same spirit and style all over the country. The building was designed with a view to saving energy, provide comfort and be eco-friendly," Dr al Kaabi stated.
The building, which accommodates up to 250 employees, consists of a ground and two floors that are fitted with all modern services, offices and halls.
