Awqaf won the Best Achievement Award for ICT Infrastructure in the category of government contact centres destined to individuals and corporates for the year 2016.
Awqaf was awarded for the best infrastructure of contact centres at the level of federal and local government entities in Abu Dhabi. The prize came to recognise the innovative solutions adopted by Awqaf, particularly the use of information technology to deliver the best services to members of the public.
Through its Cabinet-approved strategic plan and continuous efforts to keep abreast with the latest global developments in the field of electronic and smart government services, Awqaf succeeded in providing fatwa services in an innovative way through multi communication channels including website, text messages and contact centre. Recently, Awqaf upgraded the networking infrastructure of its contact centre and obtained the latest versions of  "Avaya" systems licenses.  Updates covered as well its content management system and database to provide new options useful to the user and Muftis alike.
The enhancement of the IT infrastructure of the centre led to raising its performance level, allowing it to accommodate a greater number of muftis in line with Awqaf's strategic plan, seeking to increasing number of calls and reducing disconnected calls, hence achieving the highest level of public satisfaction and excellence in service delivery in general.
