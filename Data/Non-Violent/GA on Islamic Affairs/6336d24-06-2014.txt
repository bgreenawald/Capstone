Awqaf organised in Abu Dhabi a training course to qualify a number of the new imams who recently joined Awqaf. The move is in the framework of its Cabinet-approved strategic plan, which focuses on refining and developing the talents of the Imams and developing their academic and performance skills.
The imams who attended this course were acquainted with the elements of a successful preacher, including individual, linguistic and cultural qualifications. They were also trained on the scientific theories of discourse and rhetoric.
The program of the course, which concluded yesterday, contained, as well, an introduction to the administrative tasks and duties of the Imam.
