Marking the International Workers' Day, Awqaf honoured its labourers, drivers and cleaning staff across the UAE as well as the staff from cleaning companies working at mosques.
The honoured members received awards and gifts in appreciation of their remarkable efforts, especially in keeping high hygiene standards at mosques.
The honouring was done in Abu Dhabi by HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman. On this occasion, he stressed that this initiative reflected the bright image of Islam, which is based on cooperation, compassion and noble human values.
"The honouring also brings into light the care given by the UAE wise leadership to all members of the society as well as its appreciation of the role played by this category (of workers) and keen interest in safeguarding their rights. It indicates as well the civilised level achieved by the UAE, making it a modern country whose members are cherishing happiness and tranquillity," Dr al Kaabi added.
He further expressed his gratitude to the efforts of these workers and hailed their role and achievements. Such honouring will have positive impact on them and encourage them to maintain their passion and loyalty towards work, he explained.
For their part, workers expressed their gratitude and happiness with this kind gesture, praying to Allah, the Almighty, to continue blessing the UAE with welfare, advancement and prosperity.
