Adding to its distinguished initiatives for this year, Awqaf has launched a smart email system with a view to promote its processes.
The initiative comes in line with the smart government initiative launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to provide smart government services round the clock in order to save time and efforts for customers.
The smart email system uses the latest technologies to enable the authorised officials, directors and branch directors to view their incoming emails more easily, with a feature to use digital signature to sign those emails.
Commenting on the launch, HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman, underlined the necessity to implement such smart services to ease mailing completion for senior officials from anywhere and at any time.
The system also ensures that mailings were archived in Awqaf's central information centre in order to help their retrieval when needed, while providing the latest technologies for maintaining the security and confidentiality of information.
Awqaf aspires to keep pace with smart technologies and upgrade its information structure in order to help develop and accelerate the pace of work, preserve environment and reduce cost in the best fulfilment of  UAE leadership's vision aimed at ensuring excellence at all levels .
