In response to the initiative by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President of the UAE, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, may Allah protect him, to pay tribute to the general service workers, Awqaf's branch in the Western Region conveyed its gratitude to labourers, office boys and drivers.
Mr Naser Khalfan al Mazrouei, head of Islamic affairs, presented them with gifts and certificates of appreciation on behalf of the branch's director, Mr Sultan Zayed al Mazrouei.
On this occasion, Mr Sultan al Mazrouei lauded the move by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid to honour this category of the community, saying that this is the least one can serve them and is an act of kindness and charity which Islam calls for. These people are the unsung heroes contributing to the development of work, he said.
He added that this imitative highlighted the aspects of goodness, mercy and compassion, which the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace, had called for. The same path is being followed by HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, may Allah protect him, His Deputy Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Court, the Rulers of the Emirates, General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Ruler's Representative in the Western Region.
