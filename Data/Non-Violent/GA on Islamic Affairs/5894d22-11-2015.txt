Awqaf's training centres for Imams, Khateebs and preachers completed their current courses organised at al Ain and Ras al Khaimah, accommodating 114 participants over 6 weeks.
The workshops aimed at developing the participants' skills in Arabic language, oration and khateeb's jurisprudence. Awqaf organised the first course in the second quarter this year. There were 98 Imams, Khateebs and preachers who participated in the training upon nomination by Awqaf's branches' directors all over the UAE.
Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, said that these workshops came in implementation of Awqaf's strategic plan to increase training and qualification courses in all specialisations of Awqaf. These include courses for Imams, Khateebs and preachers, who represent a live image of the purity of the Arabic language and who also serve educational purposes for the good of society, Dr Al Kaabi added.
