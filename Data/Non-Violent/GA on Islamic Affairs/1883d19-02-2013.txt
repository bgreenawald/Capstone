Part of its efforts to engage members of the public in maintaining mosques, Awqaf is undertaking a media campaign to increase their awareness to take care of Houses of Allah and deal with them in a fine manner as their sacred status requires.
Through many of its communication platforms, Awqaf will call on people to attend mosque lectures and sessions for memorising the holy Quran.
In a statement, Mr Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, the executive director of Islamic affairs, mentioned that Awqaf was keen to maintain mosques and take care of them according to the directives by the UAE wise leadership. He added that Awqaf was eager to protect mosques from anything that might affect their sacredness or drift them away from their main mission and approach.
On this occasion he lauded the unlimited support being offered to Awqaf by HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, his Deputy HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Council, the Rulers of the Emirates, and  HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
This media campaign came to implement the Cabinet decision no 39 for 2012 concerning the organisation of a media campaign urging people to take care of mosques and maintain them, Mr al Mazrouei said. For this purpose, Awqaf set up a committee at the level of its branches, which has drafted a comprehensive plan comprising a variety of awareness activities.
