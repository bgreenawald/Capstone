Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman, stressed that the UAE wise leadership was commemorating the Emirati heroes who sacrificed their lives to defend their religion, nation, honour and land.
Tribute also goes to the martyrs' mothers, fathers, families, tribes and communities for the martyrs to remain always an example to follow by the generations to come.
"We will keep the memory of our martyrs alive in our hearts and while the UAE leaders are proud of our martyrs, we are likewise proud of our leaders", Dr Al Kaabi said.
