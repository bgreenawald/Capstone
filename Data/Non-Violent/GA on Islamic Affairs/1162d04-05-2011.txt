The Heart-Health awareness campaign was recently launched at the premises of the General Authority for Islamic Affairs and Endowments (GAIAE). Activities included an educational lecture presented by Dr.Abdul Razzak  AlKaddour, Cardiologist at Sheikh Khalifa Medical City (managed by Cleveland Clinic). GAIAE employees underwent medical tests such as measuring blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, carbon monoxide level height, weight and body mass index. Tests were performed by a team of specialized physicians in addition to a nutritionist. The medical team answered queries and gave health instructions and recommendations.
Mr.Mohammed Obeid AlMarzourei, who welcomed the medical team, said that the prudent leadership is keen to offer the best health services to the UAE people. He also stressed that Islam calls upon us to maintain both our physical and mental health.
Mr. AlMazrouei added that it is important to conduct health awareness activities with the medical sector to enhance health awareness, reinforce good health and nutritional habits and strengthen social ties among people from all walks of life.
