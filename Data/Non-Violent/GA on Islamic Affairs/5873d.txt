HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman said, "HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, has always inspired us with his unique and generous initiatives. Our wise leadership has always strived to ensure glory and dignity of the nation and promote heroic acts so as they become a model and a source of pride for many generations to come."
"Blessed are the Emirati people with our remarkable leadership, and blessed are the martyrs with this national day where their status is elevated in our hearts, same as the rank that Allah prepared for them in the Hereafter. Blessed, as well, are the families of martyrs with such an achievement attained by their children who offered their lives to protect their homeland and answer the call of duty," added Dr Al Kaabi, pledging to Allah, to the UAE wise leadership and the Emirati people to be the loyal soldiers who will always answer the call of duty.
