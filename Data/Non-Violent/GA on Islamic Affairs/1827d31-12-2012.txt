Awqaf participated this year at Al Dhafra Festival with a display of 80 photographs featuring its most important achievements since its establishment. Organised by the government communication department at Awqaf, the photo exhibition attracted a large audience from all walks of life.
Mr Youssef al Khaledi, in charge of the Awqaf stand, said that the photo display guided visitors to different milestones in the Union journey up to date, including a glimpse into the hard life the forefathers had endured in the past. "The exhibition attracted many visitors from inside and outside UAE, who came to see how mosques had evolved over time and been endowed with better facilities."
Praising the efforts made this year, Mr al Khaledi said that the sixth edition of the festival was a step ahead from its preceding one thanks to its remarkable organisation. He also wished the festival would continue achieving its goals of maintaining the UAE heritage.
It is worth mentioning that the photo display of the UAE mosques organised by the government communication department at Awqaf will visit other emirates to highlight the state efforts in building and maintaining the houses of Allah as well as in promoting their social and cultural role. The photographs were the outcome of a contest launched earlier by Awqaf.
