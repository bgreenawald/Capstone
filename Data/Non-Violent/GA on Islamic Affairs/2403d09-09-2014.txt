A series of workshops to introduce a new e-correspondence system were held at Awqaf's headquarters in Abu Dhabi and were attended by authorised staff from different departments. The IT department explained various aspects of the system and how it functions.  
Awqaf's e-correspondence system was designed with the goal of organising the electronic exchange of official information, emails, letters, and attachments and so on between different departments as well as managing incoming and outgoing mails. An alternative to the conventional mailing system, the e-correspodence one is based on an attested procedure that ensures quick and secure delivery of information.
Additionally, as an electronic platform means it will use less paper, and so makes it environmentally-friendlier. Thus it will also reduce the cost in the long term.
 It is part of Awqaf'e efforts that reflect the keen interest of the UAE wise leadership to keep up with the new technology aiming at increasing performance and accomplishing efficiency. Such novel methods are also good tools to process transactions and upgrade staff performance continuously. All of this is geared towards achieving the wise leadership's vision of reaching excellence at all levels.  
The e-correspondence system will determine each user's responsibility to reply within good time, and ensure remote online and smart mobile access. At the same time, it will save time and effort usually associated with manual archiving. Doing this task electronically means mails and information will be saved in a database that can easily be searched and retrieved.
Other features are the possibility of tracking mails and replies by the authorised staff, reducing the risk of losing information and letters or changing their content, in addition to introducing electronic signature for raising the level of security and privacy.
