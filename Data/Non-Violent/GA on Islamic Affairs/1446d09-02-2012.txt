Umm Al Quwain branch gave out 200 "winter boxes" to cleaning workers and other labourers who work out in the cold weather. This came as part of a benevolent initiative called "we are with you" launched by the mutual work and excellence team in the Umm Al Quwain branch.
 The branch's director, Mohammed Ibrahim, said that this charitable action undertaken under the motto: "Advise each other to truth" was aimed at encouraging this category of workers in the Emirate to perform Isha and Fajr prayers in congregation in mosques especially during winter time.
"The extreme cold may cause them some difficulties to turn up for prayers in mosques because they may need some warmer clothes. This is why we have distributed about 200 winter boxes to these workers," said Mr Ibrahim.
He pointed out that the cleaning workers and other labourers were happy with this move, which offered them supplies they need at this time of year like jackets, shawls, blankets, wool caps and socks, and thus alleviated some financial burden on their shoulders. A meal was also served on the occasion. Mr Ibrahim mentioned that the initiative had attracted many benefactors who  were willing to contribute.
