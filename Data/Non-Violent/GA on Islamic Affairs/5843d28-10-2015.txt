As a result of the UAE's wise leadership's support and in implementation of its strategic plan, Awqaf has decided to revolutionise the architecture of memorisation centres across the country. This came after approving a unified design to build 7 model memorisation centres that will reflect the glorious status of Quran and its memorisers.
As a first phase, the new centres will be built in some of the country's Emirates. They will be fitted with state-of-the-art facilities and offer services that keep in pace with the highest standards to help learning and memorisation of Quran. Public bids for implementing the projects will be solicited to contractors before end of the year.
