HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, received Pastor Anthony Michael and Ishaq Al Anba Bishoy, Pastor of Al Anba Antonio Orthodox Coptic Cathedral Church in Abu Dhabi, and the accompanying delegation who visited Awqaf in the framework of exchanging visits aimed at promoting values of tolerance and interfaith respect as well as enhancing cooperation. Such visits also exhibit the civilised model of coexistence and openness witnessed in the UAE. 
Welcoming the delegation, Dr Al Kaabi expressed appreciation for the fruitful periodic meetings between Pastors of churches in the UAE and Awqaf and their positive role in promoting the culture of constructive dialogue and social coexistence, in light of the freedom of religions and respect of all religious sacred symbols provided by the UAE wise leadership, adding that this is a civilised example for other countries to emulate.
For their part, the delegation members greeted Awqaf and pilgrims for performing Hajj rituals and returning home safely and also greeted the UAE wise leadership and people on the occasion of Eid Al Adha.
Both sides paid their heartfelt tributes to the UAE leaders, Armed Forces and martyrs families, praying to Allah to have mercy on them and grant victory to the Coalition's efforts in the brotherly Yemen.
The meeting was attended by Mr Mohammed Obeid Al Mazrouei, Awqaf's Executive Director for Islamic Affairs and a number of Awqaf's scholars.
