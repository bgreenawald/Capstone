In presence of HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, Mr. Yusuf Ali and a large host of more than 4000 persons from the Indian Muslim community in the UAE, Indian speaker of Islam, Abdul Samad Samadani, Assistant Secretary General of the All-India Muslim League and former member in the Indian parliament, delivered a lecture at the National Theatre in Abu Dhabi.
In the beginning of his lecture, titled "Quranic Creed Glorifies Humanity", Samadani hailed the religious tolerance cherished in the UAE community under the leadership of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, praying to Allah to continue blessing him with good health and welfare. He also prayed to Allah to show mercy on the founding leader, late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace.
"We always look forward to seeing the creative initiatives of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces," said Samadani, pointing out the great positive effect of the latter's recent official visit to India, both on the Indian people and leadership.
This, he said, recalls to our minds the strong relationships between India and the Arab nation that go back deep in history, as well as the importance of Arabic, the language of the holy Quran and the mother tongue of the Messenger of Allah pbuh as well as the people of Paradise. It also brings to attention the role played by this great language in transferring the Islamic and Indian civilisations and extending cultural, religious and humane bridges between them, he added.
Samadani, then, elaborated in explaining the principles of the Quranic creed whose utmost care, he underlined, is given to the Oneness of Allah, the Most Exalted, followed by the care given to human beings, their values, happiness and prohibition of all that which may be harmful to them. For this reason, peoples entered into the religion of Islam in multitudes, he concluded.
