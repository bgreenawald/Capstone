The General Authority for Islamic Affairs and Endowments (GAIAE) is considering a plan for automatic religious endowment (waqf) donations using Zakat Fund ATM machines.
This endeavor was discussed by Mr. Khaled AlNeyadi, GAIAE executive director for waqf affairs, and Zakat Fund. Both parties agreed to study the best implementation of this proposal. Mr. AlNeyadi conveyed his interest in exploring the Zakat Fund disbursement mechanics to the needy.
