In response to the great interest by parents in benefiting from their children's summer school holidays by increasing their skills in reciting, memorising and Tafseer (interpreting) of the holy Quran, Awqaf continues to accept registration in the summer memorisation sessions. New students can directly join the sessions in more than 198 mosques (354 sessions) and a number of Quran memorisation centres. The sessions will be conducted from 4pm to 7pm starting from Sunday, July 2 through Thursday, July 27, 2017.
To help learners to get to the sessions, Awqaf provides transportation to and from their locations.
Target audience of the initiative:

 Male and female school students aged between 6 to 18 years 
 Male and female adults above 18 years of age

For more information about the locations of mosques, centres and sessions, please visit Awqaf's website www.awqaf.gov.ae or any of the Quranic centres.
