In the presence of more than 100 members of staff, Awqaf's branch in the Western Region planted 2835 date palm seedlings in all mosques there.
The Western Region branch is proceeding with planting seedlings in each mosque following the directives of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, to distribute 41000 seedlings of the finest date palms for planting them near mosques and schools, said Mr Sultan al Mazrouei.
He added that administrative employees, Imams, Muezzins and holy Quran memorisation students are putting seedlings in the ground in front of mosques and they will continue doing this until they finish planting all the tree seedlings received from the UAE University unit for date palm studies and research.  
Speaking of the initiative, Mr al Mazrouei highlighted the unlimited support received from the wise leadership to maintain mosques in accordance to the tradition set by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace.
On this occasion, he supplicated to Allah to protect HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Council, Rulers of the Emirates, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Ruler's Representative in the Western Region.
