Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan, UAE President, may Allah protect him, H.H. Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashed Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister, Ruler of Dubai as well as Their Highnesses members of the Higher Board, Rulers of the Emirates and Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
