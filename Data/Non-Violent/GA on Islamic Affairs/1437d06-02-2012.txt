 HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, the GAIAE's Director General, received HE Al Sheikh Ahmad bin Al Sheikh Abdullah, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Islamic  Affairs in Ethiopia, and the delegation accompanying him.
This came during a visit by the Ethiopian officials to the UAE to exchange views on a number of issues of mutual interest, such as promoting peaceful interfaith  coexistence between various faith followers and spreading the culture of tolerance and moderation. 
 
Mr Al Sheikh was briefed on the values, principles and goals that  the GAIAE endeavours to achieve under the kind patronage of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of UAE, may Allah protect him, who has promoted religious moderation  and tolerance as well as a culture of cooperation in many fields of charity work and humanitarian relief  efforts.
For his part, Mr Al Sheikh expressed his appreciation for  the GAIAE's achievements in managing the religious affairs. He specifically underscored the  experience of the Official Fatwa Centre in employing  the latest IT technology to communicate with the public, examine authenticity of the fatwas, document and publish them in various electronic  formats.
The Ethiopian delegation also hailed the way the Friday Khutba (sermon) is prepared and the daily preaching plan throughout the year. They likewise highlighted the special attention and care given to mosques in the UAE, which have become magnificent landmarks that foster faith and authentic religious teachings within the community.
