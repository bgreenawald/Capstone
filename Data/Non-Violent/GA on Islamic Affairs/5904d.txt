Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, stressed that the UAE's wise leaders have laid down their strategic planning based on the principles of justice, transparency, honesty and social engagement. As such, people enjoyed equality and showed responsibility in implementing such a fair system, following steps of late Sheikh Zayed, may Allah have mercy on him, who built the UAE based on justice and respect of law, Dr al Kaabi added.
Dr al Kaabi also underscored that HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, was keen on implementing a fair system in the society, where people from a large number of cultures are enjoying peaceful coexistence, fair treatment and equality in the judicial system. Dr al Kaabi concluded by saying "Such a system is an example for an ideal life that has rarely been experienced throughout history."
