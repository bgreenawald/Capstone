The drive came in conjunction with the blood donation awareness campaign held in government entities. Its aims at enhancing the concepts of collaborative social responsibility, cooperation and rescue. 
The blood drive was held at Umm Al Quwain Charitable Society. Mr.Mohammad Ibrahim Hameed, director of GAIAE Umm Al Quwain office, and his deputy were among the donors. GAIAE employees and imams also contributed. 15 blood units were collected from thirty five donors  in one day.
