As per its strategic plan approved by the Cabinet, Awqaf is organising a series of workshops from February to April with the aim of further developing Khateebs' oratory skills.
In a statement, Awqaf's director, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, said these training sessions would be attended by more than 2000 Khateebs all over the UAE following a specific schedule set by Awqaf and communicated to all of its branches.
Every workshop will last two days. During the first day, two lectures will be given: the first one will explain methods of making a Khutba more efficient and successful, and the second one will expound on the characteristics of a successful Khateeb.
On the second day, Khateebs will be advised on how to practically apply the theoretical information and guidelines. Khateebs will pronounce before their colleagues and lecturers a sermon, after which they will sit and listen to comments and feedback.
The ongoing workshops have received wide appreciation from participants, who requested more training sessions in order to further upgrade their public speaking abilities.
Delivered by experts and scholars from Awqaf, the workshops have had an immediate positive impact on Khateebs' skills as it was seen during the practical part of the training.
