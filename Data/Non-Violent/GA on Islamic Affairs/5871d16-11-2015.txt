Scholars, Muftis, Imams and Khateebs of UAE's Awqaf have denounced the terrorist attacks that took place in Paris, the capital of freedom, enlightenment and democracy.
Awqaf reiterated its unyielding support to the UAE's wise leadership in combating such hideous waves of violence, bloodshed, devastation and explosions, stressing that "the peaceful religion of Islam was sent as a mercy to mankind and such brutal, barbaric and reckless acts are none of its teachings."
