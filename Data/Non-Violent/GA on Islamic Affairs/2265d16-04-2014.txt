A workshop by Awqaf has been held in Al Bateen Centre in Abu Dhabi this week to examine the Federal National Council remarks and feedback. The meeting was presided over by HE Dr Hamdan Musallam al Mazrouei, Awqaf's chairman, and attended by HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's director general, the executive directors, department and Awqaf's branches across UAE.  
Dr al Mazrouei opens the workshop by commending the unrelenting support to Awqaf from HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, HH Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, their Brothers, Their Highness The Rulers of the Emirates, and HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
Their kind commitment has contributed greatly to the improvement of Islamic Affairs' services to the public through Friday sermons, the UAE Official Fatwa Centre, preaching and media outlets.
 He also thanked the FNC speaker and members and lauded their keen interest to upgrade the level of services delivered by Awqaf in various fields. He stressed that their observations would be duly considered and be implemented. He then reviewed the FNC remarks and recommendations on Awqaf policies, which were discussed in the third regular session of the 15th legislative term held last week.
All of the remarks and observations expressed should serve as a motivation for us to accelerate in implementing Islamic Affairs' strategic and operational plans, concluded Dr al Mazrouei.
