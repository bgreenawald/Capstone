The meeting of GAIAE office directors in the UAE was held in Al Ain city. It focused on the low level of nationals' employment in mosque jobs, especially imams. A recommendation has been issued to designate an external committee to survey and study the reasons for this lack of interest and come up with the best solutions. Furthermore, it has been decided to promote the merits and value of the role of imams in television and radio shows as well as Friday sermon.
On the other hand, the meeting discussed establishing divisions in charge of managing waqf properties (leasing, maintenance and supervision) in each GAIAE office. It has been decided to conduct a comparative study between all firms supervising GAIAE awqaf (religious endowment properties).
Meeting the needs of mosques in petroleum stations in the Northern Emirates has been tackled in addition to renovating the interior of some mosques in industrial areas.
Attendees were briefed on GAIAE achievements, namely new mosques, new Qur'an memorization centers and GAIAE future plan.
