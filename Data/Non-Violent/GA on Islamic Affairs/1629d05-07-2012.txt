The new sessions of the Holy Quran  memorisation started as of July 1, 2012, announced the GAIAE. They will be held in 34 centres and 290 mosques across the  UAE, and are expected to attract about 24000 students.
Touring some of the Quranic centres, HE Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, the Islamic Affairs executive director, said that there was a great demand for these sessions this  summer.
To help learners get to the centres, the GAIAE will provide 30 buses, Mr al Mazrouei said in a statement.
"The Quranic centres are some of the great traditions founded by the Late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace. They are beneficial to the young generations, offering them a positive pursuit and an opportunity to compete locally and internationally.
"The centres have always received a great support from HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE president, may Allah protect him, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Council, and HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, who has recently inaugurated the Suhail bin Awidha al Khubaili Islamic Centre in Al Ain," he said.
Keen to contribute to promote the religious awareness and strengthen the Quranic values amongst the new generations by increasing their skills in memorisation, Tajweed and fluency in language, the GAIAE calls upon parents and students to benefit from these sessions. The latter will continue until Ramadan 20.
