Awqaf is continuing to coordinate with the Saudi authorities to get the final form of the electronic card for the UAE pilgrims that will be readable in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, said Mr Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, the Executive Director for Islamic Affairs and Head of the Hujjaj's Affairs Office at Awqaf.
The pilgrim's electronic card, which cannot be forged, is an initiative aimed at developing, regulating and improving the administrative, technical and service procedures for the employees involved in Hajj affairs, he added.
Al Mazrouei pointed out that Awqaf had started organising workshops for Hajj and Umrah operators to brief them of the early electronic application procedures for 1436 AH Hajj season and explain the requirements of the e-track system of the Saudi Ministry of Hajj.
Else, Awqaf announced the launch of public tenders for meal distribution on the pilgrims during the coming Hajj season in memory of Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace. It invited the licensed companies registered with the UAE chambers of commerce and industry to submit their bids.
250,000
Al Mazrouei affirmed that the Hajj delegation last year distributed more than 250,000 meals on the pilgrims noting that the number of meals this year would increase. The distribution programme would begin from the day of Arafat and continue until the last day of at-Tashreeq.
The UAE's quota for the coming Hajj season is 4,982 pilgrims, mainly due to the ongoing development work within the Grand Mosque in Mecca, al Mazrouei stated. On the occasion, he praised the kind care and support received by pilgrims from the UAE's wise leadership.
