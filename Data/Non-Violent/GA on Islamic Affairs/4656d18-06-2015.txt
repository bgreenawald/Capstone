Awqaf has opened two new centres in Al Ain and Ras Al Khaimah for training Imams, Khateebs and preachers. On this occasion, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi said that this achievement was the result of the continuing support of the UAE wise leadership.
Dr al Kaabi added that this step came to translate Awqaf's strategic plan and would contribute to communicate Awqaf's mission based on principles of moderation. He explained that training in the two centres had started earlier this month and currently there are 60 trainees in each centre, attending courses five days a week.
The first session will continue until the end of this month and will feature four core subjects: Arabic language skills, namely grammar, morphology and rhetoric; elocution, including presentations, attentiveness and talent development; Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) that touches upon novel issues of modern life and practical training on the art of dialogue.
Qualified trainers from Awqaf deliver and oversee these pilot courses in the two permanent centres.
