HE Omar Hassan Ahmad al Bashir, the President of Sudan, awarded Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, the Order of the Two Niles First Class, Sudan's highest national medal.
The honouring came in recognition Awqaf's outstanding efforts and initiatives aimed at protecting the moderate religious discourse and enhancing it in accordance with the principles of Islam, taking into consideration the national, regional and international developments. This should promote the culture of tolerance and moderation amongst communities in general.
Commenting on the occasion, Dr al Kaabi said that the order is an honour for the UAE, its leadership and government, as well as a culmination of the efforts aimed at establishing fruitful cooperation between the two countries and the two brotherly people. It also recognises the UAE's various efforts and initiatives in the best interests of Sudan.

The visit is in the framework of the memorandum of understanding signed between UAE's Awqaf and the Sudanese Ministry of Guidance and Endowments.
