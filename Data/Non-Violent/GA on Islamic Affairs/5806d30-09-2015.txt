Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman, has affirmed that a comprehensive plan to develop religious awareness has been made with a view to positively interact with the mission of the UAE armed forces in Yemen, reinforce the values of loyalty and the sense of national belonging to the UAE and its wise leadership and alert people to the dangers of circulating rumours, which may affect the homeland security and stability.
The plan interacts with the call of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to fly the UAE flag on houses, farms and institutions all over the UAE to express solidarity with the UAE armed forces and the UAE wise leadership, Dr Al Kaabi added.
Dr Al Kaabi underscored that the plan features several activities such as lessons of the mosques and seminars to be held in councils and community institutions and on social networking sites. Such activities will throw light on the UAE martyrs, their status in this world and the Hereafter and their role in defending the nation and safeguarding its borders.
