Awqaf has organized a workshop on a project to develop its 4th strategic cycle for 2017- 2021 in co-operation with the concerned parties from inside and outside the UAE.
The workshop, which was held in the St. Regis Abu Dhabi, was attended by Dr. Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, Executive Director of Islamic Affairs at Awqaf, guest scholars of the UAE President HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan and a number of Awqaf executives and staff.
At the beginning of the workshop, al Kaabi said he was very happy about the participation of reputed scholars from inside and outside Awqaf in this activity, stressing that this workshop would be followed by many other workshops with a number of foundations and entities based on the fact that brainstorming would contribute to reducing gaps, if any, in the Awqaf's previous strategy.
