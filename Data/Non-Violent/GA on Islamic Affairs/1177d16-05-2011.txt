 The General Authority for Islamic Affairs and endowments (GAIAE) is pursuing its plan to improve Khatteebs' performance (religious figures delivering Friday sermons). In this regard, a training course in public speaking was conducted in Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan mosque in Abu Dhabi. The course spanned two weeks and was attended by sixty Khateebs.  More training courses are expected to be held across the UAE. The purpose of these courses is to enhance proper recitation by exposing Khatteebs to the latest trends in public speaking and highlighting the pivotal role they play in shaping the community.
Dr.Mohammed AlKaabi, GAIAE director general, said evaluation of the khatteb is done by a committee in accordance with very specific criteria to assess, monitor and evaluate his performance. Dr.AlKaabi added that highly qualified khatteebs will be honored and rewarded for their good work.
According to Dr.AlKaabi, the training courses offer lectures on different public speaking topics such as the history of public speaking, educational and language abilities of the speaker. The personality of the Khatteb, his body language and gestures, his pace and tone are all important tips to learn for delivering effective Friday sermons. The training courses also offer lectures on moderation and tolerance in Islam.
