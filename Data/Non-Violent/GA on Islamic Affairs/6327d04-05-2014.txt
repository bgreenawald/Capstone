In line with its keen interest in participating in global events, Awqaf distributed healthy meals to personnel at its branches across the UAE. It also organised a number of educational lectures marking the World Health Day, including lectures on the establishment of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1948.
This initiative comes in line with Awqaf's strategic plan to interact and participate with all its employees and directors in global events such as World Health Day. Awqaf's participation in the event is aimed at promoting the level of health and food awareness in the community and educate its members about ensuring enduring good health, welfare, and happiness in line with the sound vision of the UAE's  noble leadership.
