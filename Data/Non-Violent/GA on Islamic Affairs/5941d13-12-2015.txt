As part of its celebrations in the UAE 44th National Day, Awqaf organised a Marathon Walk with participation of 5 thousand Imams alongside a host of Khateebs, Muezzins and administrative staff from its nine branches across the country.
Participants also included Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, as well as its executive directors and department directors. The 3000-meter race started at around 8 o'clock on December 2 and ended with awards giving amid a joyous atmosphere.
Commenting on the event, Dr al Kaabi said, "this Marathon, which was launched across the Emirates and overseen by the branch directors in each emirate, comes as part of the celebrations in the UAE 44th National Day and in coordination with the ministry of interior and other competent entities. All safety measures were taken, traffic flow was controlled and participants were carefully observed."
Dr al Kaabi thanked the participants for expressing, through sports, their sincere happiness in this historical day, stressing the importance of sports in enhancing the scholars' intellectual capacities.
