Following its celebrations of the UAE 44th National Day, Awqaf has honoured labourers, cleaning staff and drivers. This move came as an appreciation of their remarkable efforts that contributed to the success of Awqaf in commemorating both the Martyrs Day and the National Day.
The staff members were honoured by HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, who handed them in-kind awards as well as appreciation certificates, expressing his thanks to their extra efforts and encouraging them to maintain their passion and loyalty towards work.
