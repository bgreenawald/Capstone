HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and his prudent government exerted tremendous efforts over the past years, said Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman.
"They made the best use of time, narrowed distances and exerted all possible efforts for the UAE to have great potentials," added Dr al Kaabi, noting that their efforts in all the UAE's ministries, authorities and organisations were going as per strategic plans and visions of great impact on serving the UAE and the Emirati people."
"HH Sheikh Mohammed is a diligent, gallant, and valiant person, who devoted his work, commitment and aptitudes to bring happiness to the UAE people," said Dr al Kaabi.
"The UAE nowadays is incomparable and its rivals can only seek its assistance or emulate it in terms of the progress it has achieved," added Dr al Kaabi. He stressed that the thanks that HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, extended to HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum was a gesture of appreciation to one of his men and leaders.
Dr al Kaabi continued saying: "it is such a nice gesture and a great value because it has an important effect and gives a pleasant and encouraging impression."
Dr al Kaabi also hailed HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan's kind patronage, national follow-up and paternal development outlook towards all the UAE matters.
"However, there is no wonder in this because HH Sheikh Khalifa graduated from the school of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace. It is this school that we as young and old, men and women, leaders and subordinates look at with admiration. HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is also a graduate of this same school," Dr al Kaabi concluded.
