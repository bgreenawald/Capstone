GAIAE office in Um al Quwain has received the construction blueprints for 13 new mosques, out of which 6 mosques will replace old ones. The estimated construction cost is 15 million dirhams which will be covered by generous contributors in GAIAE "Sandy Grove Nest" campaign.
Mr.Mohammad Obeid AlMazrouei, GAIAE executive director for Islamic affairs, said that the design of the new mosques will blend Islamic-style and traditional Emirati architecture. It will be in harmony with the grand and ongoing urban planning and evolution in the UAE.
He applauded the generous contributions of Um al Quwain nationals in GAIAE campaign launched two years ago to replace an old mosque with a new one designed to accommodate more than 200 worshippers. It is worth mentioning that the new mosque costs 1.170.000 dirhams. Mr.AlMazrouei is hopeful to be able to complete other projects underway with more generous contributions.
He noted that new mosques construction will span two years and is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
Mr. AlMazrouei added that GAIAE office in Um al Quwain will undertake the supervision of construction work of the new mosques which can accommodate between 200 and 1000 worshippers
