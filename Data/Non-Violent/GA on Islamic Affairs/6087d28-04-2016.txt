Starting April 1, Awqaf implemented the "flexitime" work system for all the employees at its branches across the UAE.
Commenting on the occasion, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, affirmed that the decision taken by the UAE's wise government to implement the flexible working arrangements offers ease for employees and more transparency, which leads to increased productivity.
"Under the flexitime policy, employees will be able to coordinate their work hours with the daily traffic patterns to avoid high congestion times, hence giving them enough time to reach safely without rushing and taking risk. This will eventually bring them happiness and comfort, enable them to be more productive, and allow them to show more of their creativity, talents and capabilities. It will also open the gateways for them to innovate and develop new ways to improving the quality of their output," Dr al Kaabi added.
According to the resolution, the time for arriving at office starts from 7 AM until 8:30 AM. Thus, employee's 7 regular working hours will be calculated starting from the time of their actual arrival according to that time window. The new arrangement is applicable from Sunday to Thursday.
