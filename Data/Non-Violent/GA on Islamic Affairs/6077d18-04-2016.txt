In ceremonies held at Quran memorisation centres in Abu Dhabi, Awqaf honoured the mothers of the holy Quran memorisers. The honoured mothers were presented with gifts and appreciation certificates in recognition of the commendable role they played in raising the children and upbringing the generations.
On the occasion, HE Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, the Executive Director of Islamic Affairs, thanked the mothers for their persistence in encouraging their sons and daughters to memorise the Quran and learn its sciences. He explained the virtues of reading and memorising the Quran and its role in educating generations who would be helpful for themselves, their families and their homeland.
Al Mazrouei expressed his thanks to the UAE's wise leadership for the great care given to the Quranic centres and memorisation sessions in mosques, as well as for its directives to provide them with all the necessary requirements. He prayed to Allah to have mercy on the founding father and the builder of UAE, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, who laid down the foundations of Quran memorisation centres in the country.
Al Mazrouei stressed Awqaf's keen interest to upgrade the Quran memorisation centres in terms of curriculum and infrastructure in order to serve the Book of Allah, the Almighty, and achieve its strategic objectives. This includes supporting those centres, organising memorisation sessions in mosques and providing them with the necessary financial resources, transportation and teaching methods in order to receive young and adult students as well as housewives and help them  better to learn the Quran recitation, he added.
Al Mazrouei concluded by urging the mothers to make seize this opportunity and encourage their children further to join those centres and sessions.
