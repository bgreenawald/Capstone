In its second edition, the PAN Arab Web Awards Academy honoured the GAIAE's  facebook account www.facebook.com/AwqafUAE as the best socially interactive Facebook fan page.
About this outstanding achievement, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, the GAIAE's director general said, "with the generous support from the wise UAE leadership, Awqaf is seeking to be a leader in using the new technology applications in research and Fatwa issuance as well as in various administrative and technical fields.
"Indeed, this award came to add to many other achievements which Awqaf has obtained. We have been successful thanks to Allah, the Most Exalted, and the continuous help and care of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, may Allah protect him, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Council, HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces."
Dr al Kaabi added that the GAIAE had also been keen to involve the public in its programmes by receiving their opinions, feedback and suggestions through social network websites and gateways available on its website. "This has encouraged individuals to positively and continuously interact with us. We therefore value their remarks and carefully studied them," Dr al Kaabi said.
On behalf of the GAIAE, Ms Atheeja Alzaabi, director of the government communication department, received the award in a ceremony organised at Grand Hyatt Resort in Amman, Jordan, by the Academy in cooperation with the National Centre for Documentation, the Arab League and Microsoft Corporation. The convention gathered many figures in the field of information technology and communication, government officials, diplomats, bankers, representatives from the media and several guests from the Arab world.
