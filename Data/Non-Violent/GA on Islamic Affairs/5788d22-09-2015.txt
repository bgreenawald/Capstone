HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf chairman, said that the UAE is living through a historical moment when martyrs have united the UAE people, old and young, men and women,. Martyrs have drawn a picture of national unity where the close relationship between the people and the wise leadership is highlighted, added Al Kaabi.
"We are hoisting the UAE flag high to express the sincerest feelings of love and loyalty to the UAE, as well as gratitude to the UAE martyrs who have sacrificed their precious lives to defend justice, support the oppressed and deter the oppressor. The martyrs have shown that the UAE people act like one family. They follow their wise leaders and proud of the sacrifices made by their martyrs," Dr Al Kaabi said.
Awqaf has laid down an integrated plan to raise religious awareness for positive response to the mission of the UAE Armed Forces in Yemen and to reinforce values of loyalty and a national sense of belonging to the UAE and its wise leadership. The plan includes conducting several events that emphasise the martyrs of the UAE and their status in this life and the Hereafter, as well as the importance of defending the homeland, protecting its borders and maintaining its security and stability. The events further focus on the religious, national and humanitarian standing of the UAE Armed Forces and the close relationship between the UAE rulers and its people, as well as cooperation and solidarity among the GCC countries in response to the call of duty in Yemen.
