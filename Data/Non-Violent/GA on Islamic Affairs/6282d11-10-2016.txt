Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, received at Awqaf headquarters in Abu Dhabi Mr. Goetz Lingenthal, the Ambassador of Germany to the UAE, and the accompanying delegation who came to learn about Awqaf's experience in promoting the noble meanings of Islam.
Dr al Kaabi welcomed the German Ambassador and briefed him on Awqaf and its role in nurturing the principles of moderation and forbearance, combatting extremism and violence as well as spreading the values of tolerance and peaceful co-existence amongst all the constituents of the community. This translates the directives by the UAE wise leadership that are aimed at establishing the UAE as a symbol of peace, co-existence and compassion as well as an oasis of security and safety, Dr al Kaabi explained.
For his part the German ambassador expressed his delight with the hospitality he received at Awqaf and admiration of its praiseworthy achievements in the Islamic affairs. He also hailed the great role played by Awqaf in instilling the tolerant teachings of Islam and reflecting its civilised image.
