Awqaf approved license renewal for 142 Hajj operators, to practice inside the UAE. It also allowed them to merge into 30 main Hajj campaigns that would serve the entire UAE pilgrims community totaling at 4982, citizens and residents. Awqaf allowed a quota of 33 pilgrims for each operator; 31 citizens and 2 residents, demanding that Hajj packages cost must be the same for both.
In this regard, Awqaf stressed the need for each pilgrim to sign a contract with the operator of their choice. Following the signing the contract, Awqaf will grant applicants Hajj permits.
On this occasion, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, clarified that those who wish to perform pilgrimage this year can register with any of the Hajj operators from May 26 to June 23, 2016. Pilgrims can leave UAE to the holy sites starting from Thursday, 8 August 2016, he added. Pilgrims are expected to return back to the UAE starting from September16, 2016.
At this instance, Awqaf calls on applicants not to register with any Hajj operators from outside UAE. It also urges them to register with the accredited operators as fast as possible and within the dates officially announced.
In order to protect pilgrims from falling victims of illegal campaign operators, Awqaf publishes its accredited contactors across the emirates in detail. A list of Hajj campaign operators accredited for this season is enclosed here.
