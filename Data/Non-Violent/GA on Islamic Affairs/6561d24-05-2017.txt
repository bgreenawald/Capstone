The Emirates Association for Social Development in Ras Al Khaimah, in cooperation with Awqaf's branch in the emirate, yesterday launched a voluntary campaign under the motto "Cleaning and Perfuming Mosques". The move is in response to the initiative declaring 2017 as the "Year of Giving".
87 volunteers participated in the campaign that targeted a number of mosques in various districts in Ras Al Khaimah, including al Dhait South, al Golan, Shamel, Ras al Khaimah, al Qusaidat and al Rams.
The campaign is aimed at taking care of mosques, keeping them clean and fragranced, providing them with carpets and chairs for worshipers, in addition to hanging guiding posters on ablution and supplications that will benefit worshipers.
Commenting on the occasion, Khalaf Salim bin Anbar, the manager of the association, said that the campaign is part of the Association's initiatives in the Year of Giving, noting that it allows the opportunity for Emiratis to perform acts of goodness, being an inherent quality of them, and contribute in all that which may promote the spirit of cooperation and giving in the society.
"The Emirates Association for Social Development strives to keep mosques ready and take care of them as well as offer tranquil atmosphere inside them, especially during the holy month of Ramadan," Bin Anbar concluded.
