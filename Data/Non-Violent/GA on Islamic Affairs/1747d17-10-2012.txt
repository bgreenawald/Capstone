Mr Sultan Zayed al Mazrouei, director of Awqaf's branch in the Western Region, toured Awqaf's offices and mosques on Delma Island and met staff and Imams there.
"The tour came to translate the keen interest of our wise leadership and the direct follow up of HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed, the Ruler's representative in the Western Region, to meet the needs of mosques in cities there. It is also part of a series of field visits by Awqaf to regularly monitor those needs and cater for them," al Mazrouei said.
