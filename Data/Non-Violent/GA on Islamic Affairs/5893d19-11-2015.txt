Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, has stressed that thanks to the supreme directives of the UAE's wise leadership that focus on quality and innovation, Awqaf has been able to gain a growing customer satisfaction through continuous modernisation and development of its service delivery. This is also achieved through the introduction of new creative programmes in fields of preaching, guidance, Islamic and endowments affairs in line with the UAE's strategic plan 2021, he added.
"As a federal entity, one of Awqaf's top priorities is keeping abreast of latest developments and meeting aspirations of the country's prudent leadership in creating an innovative environment for citizens in all walks of life. Indeed, this is a globally leading model that will bring about magnificent outcomes. It will not only reflect in sustained happiness for each citizen and resident, but also increase the fruits of employing modern technology and smart applications, a field in which the UAE has become a leader," Dr al Kaabi said.
Dr al Kaabi also note that innovation is a vital aspect for all government ministries and entities in order to address future challenges and ensure innovative and user-friendly service delivery for the good of all customers.
