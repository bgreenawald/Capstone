During a meeting held recently at Awqaf's Official Hajj Mission office in Mecca, the UAE Hujjaj Affairs' Office (HAC) launched a call centre to serve UAE's pilgrims in the Holy Places.
Mr Hamad Youssef Al Mualla, HAC's Deputy Head for Support Services, and chairs of the Official Hajj Mission's sub-committees said the establishment of the call centre is part of Awqaf's efforts to meet all the needs of the UAE's pilgrims through the support system implemented by the mission.
"The call centre includes all the service committees operating under HAC and is aimed at coordinating the services provided to UAE's pilgrims," added Mr Al Mulla.
