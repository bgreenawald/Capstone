Awqaf inaugurated the Afraa Bint Mohammed Ahmed al Qubaisi Mosque in Shakhbout city, a modern area in Abu Dhabi. Present at the opening ceremony were Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, Director of Awqaf's Abu Dhabi branch and a number of its senior officials alongside a host of worshipers from the public.
The attendees performed al Maghreb prayer amidst delight of the residents of the area with the opening of the new mosque.
Commenting on the occasion, Dr al Kaabi said that the mosque constituted a new type of architecture, keeping pace with the structural development in modern cities. It also comes in the framework of Awqaf's Cabinet-approved strategic plan, and is a fruit of the partnership between Awqaf and the national entities and philanthropists in the UAE, added he.
"This mosque adds to the other mosques that were constructed by Awqaf in Shakhbout City, making 13, in addition to another 3 mosques under construction and scheduled to be inaugurated in 2017," Dr al Kaabi pointed out, adding that all those mosques, similar to others in the country, feature sustainability and the aesthetics of the Islamic architectural style.
The mosque accommodates around 500 worshipers and is fitted with all supplementary services as well as two accommodations for the Imam and Khateeb.
