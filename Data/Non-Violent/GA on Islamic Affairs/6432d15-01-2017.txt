HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, held a video conference with Awqaf's executive directors, department managers and branch directors across the UAE to discuss mechanism of implementing the instructions of HH the UAE President for Istisqaa prayer (rain-seeking prayer) to be established all over the country.
HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE President, may Allah protect him, called on all Muslims in the country to establish prayer for rain, following the Sunna of the Prophet pbuh, seeking Allah's favour to bless the nation with rain and mercy.
During the meeting, Dr al Kaabi said that mosques' Imams will educate the public about the Istisqaa prayer and how to perform it. They will also call on people to attend the prayer. This will be done during the lessons at mosques, after al Asr prayer on Monday 9/1/2017  and through TV and radio.
Dr al Kaabi further urged all newspapers, radio and satellite channels to join efforts in explaining the rules of Istisqaa prayer as well as the spiritual and humanitarian goals of performing it in line with the tradition of the Prophet pbuh, his companions and all those who follow them, including scholars, religious jurists and righteous people.
In the same regard, Awqaf named the main Khateeb and the backup Khateeb for each mosque allocated for the Istisqaa prayer in each of the Emirates.
