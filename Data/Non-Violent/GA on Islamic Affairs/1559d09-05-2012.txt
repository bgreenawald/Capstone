The GAIAE has been granted three ISO quality certificates in recognition of  its performance in the quality management and health and occupational safety management.
The internationally acclaimed  ISO 9001:2008; 14001:2004 and the OHSA 18001:2007 came to add to the Awqaf's record of achievements. They also confirm its adherence to the highest standards in regard to strategic planning and organisational excellence.
The GAIAE dedicated this remarkable achievement to the UAE leadership and the nation, acknowledging the good model the judicious UAE leaders have set for everyone.
HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, the GAIAE's director general, said, "For us this is only one step to achieve our development, management, cultural and social goals. Seeking excellence is one the purposes of our religion and the vision of our leadership. It is a pursuit to consistently offer a distinguished model of performance.
"We therefore endeavour to translate our nation's ambition to be amongst the best advanced countries in the world. Our mission is to best serve our religion, nation, leadership and community. We do this by building mosques, investing in the Waqf funds, developing the Holy Quran memorisation centres, and spreading religious knowledge. We also work for promoting the highest values of peaceful coexistence, moderation, tolerance, dialogue, acceptance of the other, and fostering  sublime human relationships."
Dr al Kaabi seized this opportunity to praise the relentless support of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Council, and HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
