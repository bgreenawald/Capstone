The GAIAE's director general, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, presided over a meeting to preassess the necessary preparations for the next Haj season. This included assigning the location of campaign sites and camps in Mina and Arafat. The meeting was also attended by Mr Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, the head of the official Haj delegation, and his deputy Mr Obeid Hamad Al Zaabi.
Dr al Kaabi opened the meeting by highlighting the invaluable support that the Awqaf and the official Haj delegation are receiving from HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, may Allah protect him, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Council, and HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
He also acknowledged the keen interest of their highness in all of the GAIAE's projects and the official Haj delegation's programmes, which has helped the latter to improve its services. The Awqaf through the Haj and Umra department is seeking all means to upgrade all Haj related services and ensure pilgrims' satisfaction, he said.
The meeting also discussed ways to provide tents to campaigns while staying at Mina and Arafat, assign preachers, male and female, and distribute publications prepared by the GAIAE to pilgrims, as well as the appointment of the official Haj delegation members.
