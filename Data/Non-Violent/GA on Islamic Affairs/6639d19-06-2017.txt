The Salim Mohammed Baloutya Majlis in Al Ain hosted a valuable lecture by Dr Mohammed Bashar Arafat, Chairman of Islamic Affairs Council in Maryland, USA and Chairman of Civilisations Exchange and Cooperation Foundation. Dr Arafat is also one of the scholars, guests of HH the UAE President, may Allah protect him.
The lecture was characterised by pleasant novelty and practical experience in explaining the meaning of tolerance in Islam to the others. It was also attractive due to its nature, for it narrated real occurrences and stories about a number of workshops and meetings that the lecturer organised for some groups of university students in the USA. Such workshops and meetings brought together male and female students from all religions, cultures and nationalities, including Arab, Asian, European and African students studying in the US as well as Americans. Dr Arafat used to accompany the students in tours to the mosques, churches and worship places in the US, explaining to them the significance of tolerance, in theory and in practice, for exchanging knowledge and the culture of tolerance as well as for cultural cooperation amongst nations.
The lecturer then highlighted that tolerance is a virtue that Islam takes the lead in introducing it before any other civilised community, whether in the past or in the modern age. He brought the UAE as a live example where more than 200 nationalities are co-existing peacefully, cherishing freedom of work and worship that are guaranteed to them by the UAE government. The latter also allowed this cultural mixture to live in the UAE in a positive, cooperative and peaceful manner, he added, stressing that the UAE society is an ideal model for tolerance and acceptance of the other. All people are treated equally before the UAE law, which criminalises discrimination, hatred and extremism, he concluded.
