Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, has praised the law against hate and discrimination issued by HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, which criminalizes all forms of offense to religions and sanctities as well as hate and blasphemy addresses. The law not only criminalizes all forms of discrimination on the basis of religion, creed, caste, origin, color or race, but all utterances or acts that call for sedition or terming other religious groups or individuals as infidels or unbelievers.
Al Kaabi considered this decree as a starting point for rationalizing moderation, compassion and tolerance discourse, which reinforced the spotless image of Islam because hatred is a culture of narrow-mindedness that leads to racism, violence and repulsion among the components of a society and subsequently among peoples, countries and civilizations, this being against the wish of all those of vision .
Honourable record
Al Kaabi continued saying: "The UAE under the leadership of the President HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan still has an honourable record in coexistence and religious tolerance amongst all people living in it as embodied in enacting laws and regulations that protect their beliefs, respect their customs and traditions and provide people with the freedom to perform their rituals in a fair and transparent manner. This eliminates any religious or ethnic fanaticism in the country, because such fanaticism is not allowed by mosques, other houses of worship, in the curricula of schools and universities, in the mass media, nor in any trend as it is against the spirit of co-operation, co-existence and stability."
Model
Al Kaabi said it was the religious and social scholars who decided that man is by nature a social animal; hence, no people should allow an extremist organization or group to spread the culture of hate to man because this would cripple common interests, mutual values ​​and humanization of civilizations.
Al Kaabi praised the UAE model of tolerant society where more than 200 nationalities live and their affairs are managed by the UAE prudent leadership.
