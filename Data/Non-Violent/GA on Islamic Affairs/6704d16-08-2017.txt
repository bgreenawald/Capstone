Having left to the holy places last Wednesday, the UAE preparatory Hajj mission continues fulfilling its preparatory tasks pertaining to pilgrims' camps in Mina and Arafat. As such, it closely follows up work progress by the assigned contractors to ensure that work was progressing as planned ahead of the Hajj season.
The mission is also preparing for receiving the pilgrims at airports, the aim being to help in facilitating their entry and housing procedures as well as make sure that appropriate facilities and services have been arranged by the Hajj campaign operators. The first batch of pilgrims are set to arrive in Al Madinah on 21/8/2017.
Commenting on this, Dr Mohammad Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman and Head of the UAE Official Hajj mission, said that in line with the UAE wise leadership's directives to harness all efforts that are conducive to touch UAE pilgrims' hearts with happiness, the mission has completed 60 per cent of the construction of the camps and setting up their facilities during the few past days.
"The mission members were given guidelines to furnish the camps with appropriate numbers and sizes of air conditioners and power generators in order to be prepared for any heat waves that may be experienced in the region," Dr al Kaabi added, pointing out that the tents, this year, were made of heat-proof material. The mission members were also instructed to ensure providing the camps with sufficient facilities and services, he further stressed.
Concluding his comments, Dr al Kaabi extended thanks and appreciation to the government of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques for offering all requirements necessary to the UAE official Hajj mission, including land plots, camps and facilities.
