HE Dr Hamdan Musallam al Mazrouei, the GAIAE's Chairman, received Rev Esam Barsoum, Pastor of the Anglican Church of Abu Dhabi, who came to congratulate him after the Awqaf had obtained  the Sheikh Khalifa Government Excellence Award under the category of public entities that achieved highest results and been awarded three ISO certificates.
The Awqaf is  the first religious authority around the world to be ISO certified, said Dr Husam al Qurahi, the regional director of TUV, the awarding body.
On this occasion, Dr al Mazrouei highlighted the interfaith communication in the UAE under the wise leadership of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Council, and HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
He also praised the vision of the prudent leadership, which had strongly established the prospects of cooperation and tolerance amongst various religious communities in the UAE. This policy is a continuation of the approach set by the founder of the nation late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace.
"This culture allies with the traditions of other societies elsewhere and the values advocated by various international venues. All of this represents some of the genuine goals of the faith, based on respecting the human being and serving his interests," he said.
For his part, Rev Barsoum reported that all religious communities here are treated with uttermost respect by the UAE leadership and people. He also lauded the religious tolerance that characterises the country, stressing that the UAE is promoting principles of moderation and easiness.
