Awqaf announced that the eighth edition of its annual Quran memorisation contest is now open for registration from March 12, 2017. The contest will see the participation of contestants from Awqaf's Quran memorisation centres, sessions in mosques and the officially registered Quran memorisation centres in the UAE, besides inmates belonging to correctional and punitive institutions as well as institutions for people with special needs across the country.
Speaking on the occasion, Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, said the organisation of this competition at the level of the UAE comes in framework of its Cabinet-approved strategic plan, the aim being to motivate the generations to memorise and recite the holy Quran and learn its sciences.
Dr al Kaabi underlined that, thanks to Allah and the support from the UAE wise leadership, the UAE Quran memorisation centres have become model educational beacons that are equipped with the latest educational methods, keeping in pace with the overall civilised renaissance in the country.
Dr al Kaabi added that, out of its keen interest to serve people from all walks of life and cultures in the UAE, Awqaf provides a unified, multi-language curriculum for all the Quran memorisation centres.
Concerning the phases of the contest, Dr al Kaabi explained that it consists of four phases: the primary qualifiers (phase one) to continue until 23 March 2017 at Quran memorisation centres and participating facilities. During this phase, specific number of contestants will be nominated. Next comes the pre-qualifiers (phase two) at the level of Awqaf's branches, to kick off on Sunday April 9 and continues through April 20. This will be followed by the finals (phase three), from 8 to 18 May in Abu Dhabi, which will lead to the final day capping the competition. Winners will be honoured in Abu Dhabi during the holy month of Ramadan, Dr al Kaabi further clarified.
Valuable prizes will be awarded to the first, second and third winners in the award's categories, except for the eleventh category which is dedicated for honouring Quran memorisers from the Quranic centres.
