HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and his judicious government exerted tremendous efforts over the past years, said Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman.
"They made the best use of time, narrowed distances and put forth all possible efforts for the UAE to have great potentials," Dr al Kaabi added, noting that their efforts in all the UAE's ministries, authorities and organisations were going as per strategic plans and visions of great benefit to the UAE and the Emirati people.
"HH Sheikh Mohammed is a diligent, bold and intrepid person who devoted his work, commitment and aptitudes to bring happiness to the UAE people," said Dr al Kaabi.
"The UAE nowadays is unique and its rivals can only seek its assistance or emulate it in terms of the progress it has achieved," Dr al Kaabi added. He stressed that the thanks that HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, extended to HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum was a gesture of appreciation to one of his men and leaders.
Dr al Kaabi continued saying: "it is such a beautiful gesture and a great value because it has an immense effect and gives a pleasant and encouraging impression."
Dr al Kaabi also hailed HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan's kind patronage, national follow-up and keen interest in the development outlook of all the UAE matters.
"In fact, this comes as no surprise. HH Sheikh Khalifa is an impressive man and a distinguished graduate of the school of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul. It is this school that we as young and old, men and women, leaders and subordinates look at with admiration. HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum is another graduate of the same school," Dr al Kaabi concluded.
