In response to the instructions of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, to convert all ministries and federal authorities' services into smart platform, Awqaf has achieved the target of 100%. The electronic and smart transformation includes all services destined to individuals and entities, hence translating the vision of the wise leadership into a practical action plan.
Awqaf Chairman, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, stated that Awqaf is keen to benefit from every modern electronic means for providing its services to the public in the easiest and best ways. This has allowed it to be amongst the first government institutions to launch a smart application and to see the number of visitors to its website and users of its smart services in constant rise, added Dr al Kaabi.
Electronic and smart transformation included the social services such as religious and awareness lectures, endowments, Fatwas through the UAE official Fatwa Centre, issuance of Haj and Umra licences to operators in addition to control services like monitoring religious publications and printing the holy Quran, among others.
As part of its e-Government and mGovernment strategic plan, Awqaf is upgrading its website structure and smart application. The next versions will see the addition of new services that answer the needs of the community by surveying the users' opinion and coordinating with the concerned departments at Awqaf.
