The GAIAE's board of directors issued the decision no 3 of 2012 to establish new offices for its branch in Al Ain. The project is set  to be completed by the end of 2013.
Mr Khlaled Mohammed Al Neyadi, the executive director at the GAIAE, said that the Awqaf had approved the final architectural model and design of the new premises, which will occupy a total area of  3,600 sqm, of which 2,900 sqm will be for offices and the remainder for other facilities. It  will be located in the Al Ain administrative centre.
The new premises will be spacious,  featuring three floors, reception halls, waiting areas, meeting rooms, a lecture hall of more than 1200 seats, staff lounges in addition to underground car parking spaces. With such features, the new offices' building will provide a convenient place for staff and visitors alike. It will take 18 month to construct.
On this occasion Mr Al Neyadi hailed the unrelenting support of the wise UAE leadership and their commitment to good actions benefitting both the GAIAE's plans of expansion and development of  the community at large.
"The Awqaf has taken into account the Islamic architectural character in designing the new premises, which will be an architectural addition to the urban landscape in Al Ain," he said, adding "the new project will also contribute to energy efficiency and offer a convivial interior environment marked by Islamic decoration and ornaments. It will also help in rationalising the use of water, reducing harmful emissions, such as carbon dioxide from sources of water cooling systems, and indirectly preserving the micro environment in Al Ain."
