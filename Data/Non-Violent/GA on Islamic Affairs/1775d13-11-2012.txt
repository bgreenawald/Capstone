Pilgrims are invited to forward any suggestions and complaints they may have regarding the services provided to them by various operators during this year's Haj season. This came in a recent announcement by Awqaf with the aim of improving Haj and Umra services and setting standards of excellence.
Pilgrims can do this through a dedicated service named complaints and suggestions, which is available on Awqaf's website: www.awqaf.gov.ae. They can also come personally and lodge their complaints with the Haj and Umra department at Awqaf's Headquarters in Abu Dhabi or with its branches all over the UAE. Moreover, they can contact the authorised department via Fax at 026212467.
"The directives of the prudent leadership to the official Haj delegation to provide utmost care to pilgrims and ensure their safety and comfort made of this Haj season a success. There were no obstacles throughout Haj," chairman of the official delegation, HE Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei," said.
On a related note, Awqaf has signed a contract with the Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research to undertake a survey to assess the pilgrims' satisfaction.
