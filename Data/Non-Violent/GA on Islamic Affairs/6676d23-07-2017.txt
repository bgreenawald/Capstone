Awqaf has extended the summer Quran memorisation sessions till the beginning of schools in the UAE. The move came in light of the increasing demand on the holy Quran memorisation centres and sessions in mosques. It is also in line with Awqaf's keen interest in allowing the opportunity for male and female students to invest their summer holidays in developing their skills related to Quran memorisation, Tajweed, Tafseer (interpretation) and moral education.
The decision was taken after a field tour on Tuesday by Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, during which he visited the Quran memorisation sessions in Al Bahiya and Al Falah areas in Abu Dhabi. As part of the tour, Dr Al Kaabi met with the male and female students, tutors and a number of parents. He hailed the support to the Quran memorisation centres by the UAE wise leadership and the care given by Emirati Sheikhs to moral education and the values acquired by young generations through the guidance of the holy Quran.
Dr Al Kaabi further expressed his thanks to the male and female tutors for their efforts in implementation of the UAE astute leadership's initiative, supporting the march of giving in the year of giving and in the country of giving.
Dr Al Kaabi then listened to several recitations of the Quran verses by male and female students from different age groups and levels, explaining to them their status in the eyes of Allah, the Most Exalted, as well as the status of their parents who encouraged them to read the Quran and join its memorisation sessions. He assured them of a bright future within the boundaries of their prosperous country.
During the tour, Dr Al Kaabi was accompanied by a number of department managers and staff concerned with Islamic affairs and memorisation centres.
