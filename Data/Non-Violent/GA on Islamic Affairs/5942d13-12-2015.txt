The Government Communication Department at Awqaf in collaboration with Sheikh Khalifa Medical City in Abu Dhabi organised a health awareness campaign on diabetes.
The event included medical tests for Awqaf male and female employees in Abu Dhabi and medical consultations about the disease as well as its risks and ways of prevention. The initiative comes in implementation of the Government Communication Department's operation plan to communicate and interact with the UAE community and health institutions and benefit from their programmes. It also keeps up with Awqaf's mission and vision.
Marking the World Diabetes Day 2015, Sheikh Khalifa Medical City is organising an intensive week of activities aimed at raising awareness of this chronic disease known as the silent killer, encouraging all individuals of the society to adopt healthy lifestyles to protect themselves from diabetes, and educating diabetics on how to deal with the disease and avoid its complications.
Awqaf employees interacted with this campaign by showing interest in measuring their blood sugar rates and listening to the medical guidelines about this disease with a view to boosting their awareness about Diabetes as well as its causes and ways of prevention. They also showed keenness to follow healthy and sound diets that would contribute to maintaining their health and safety. They praised Awqaf's move and continuous attention to ensuring their safety. It is worth mentioning that Awqaf organises such campaigns for its employees on an annual basis.
