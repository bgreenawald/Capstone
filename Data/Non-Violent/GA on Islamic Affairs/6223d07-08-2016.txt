Awqaf's website attracted more than one million visitors from around the globe during Ramadan 2016, an estimated increase of around 60 per cent compared to 2015.
The remarkable increase in visits to the website's internal pages is attributed to several factors including the increasing public trust in Awqaf and the services it offers, being the official reference for Fatwa in the UAE and the beacon of moderation, tolerance and sound religious discourse.
Another factor lies also in the great interest in the website and the quick and effective access to its electronic services that are offered to members of the public from all age groups and all walks of life.
During Ramadan this year, the Awqaf website recorded around 160 thousand visits to the Friday speeches in addition to around one million visits to the Fatwa section. Visitors of the website come from 192 countries around the world.
As part of its continuous efforts to keep abreast with the latest global developments in the field of smart technology, Awqaf's website goes under regular update of its content and services in both Arabic and English. This also comes in implementation of the m-Government transformation initiative launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, which promotes innovation with an ultimate goal of achieving the UAE wise government's strategic objective in being "Number 1".
The website always holds advanced positions among national and regional websites. In 2015, an assessment of the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority classified it among the distinguished categories, scoring 97 per cent overall.
