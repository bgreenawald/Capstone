Awqaf has donated one million dirham in response to Our Hearts with the People of Syria initiative of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, and the stewardship of HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Ruler's Representative in the Western Region, the Chairman of UAE Red Crescent Authority (RCA).
This humanitarian move is aimed at bringing relief to Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries, which are affected by a cold snap.
 Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's director general, handed over a check of one million dirham to Mr Rashid Mubarak al Mansouri, deputy secretary general for local affairs at RCA, in the presence of Mr Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, the executive director of Islamic Affairs, and Mr Hasan Salem al Housani, director of human resources and financial affairs.
This campaign, which came upon directives from HH Sheikh Khalifa, may Allah protect him, stems from his keen interest to alleviate the sufferings of Syrians and help them endure the difficult situation where they go through, said Dr al Kaabi, adding that this unfortunately has led to a serious shortage in the basic equipment and living necessities.
