Awqaf's branch of Umm Al Quwain completed the construction of Sheikh Ahmad bin Rashid Al Mualla Mosque in Al Raas area. The new mosque, expected to open soon, has a capacity of 2000 worshippers and 700 parking lots. The construction work took 15 months.
On this occasion, Mr Mohammed Humaid, Awqaf's branch director in Umm Al Quwain, praised the unlimited support of HH Sheikh Saud bin Rashid Al Mualla, Member of the supreme Council and Ruler of Umm Al Quwain, to Emiratis and expatriates in the Emirate, and his keen interest to provide every means of comfort for worshippers.
The replacement of the previous mosque known as Al Raas, a thirty-year old facility, came in response to directives from HH Sheikh Saud bin Rashid, who ordered the replacement of the old mosque as quickly as possible at his own expenses after it could no longer host the increasing number of worshippers, Mr Humaid said.
He further mentioned that the interior and exterior designs featured Islamic heritage architecture and ornaments, yet they reflected the urban development witnessed across the UAE.  In addition to the main prayer hall, the mosque includes a women prayer room, accommodations for the Imam and Muezzin and two rooms for receiving and washing dead bodies.
The mosque was first built in 1976 by the Late Sheikh Rashid bin Ahmad Al Mualla, may Allah rest his soul in peace, and had since then been maintained more than five times.
