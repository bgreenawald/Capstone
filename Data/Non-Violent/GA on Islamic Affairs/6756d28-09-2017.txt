Senior officials in the UAE have affirmed that the honouring of HH Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak, Chairwoman of the General Women's Union, Supreme Chairwoman of the Family Development Foundation and President of the Supreme Council for Motherhood and Childhood, with the "Agent of Change" award for leading women in the field of peace and security by the UN Women and the Global Partnerships Forum came in recognition of her leading role in women's empowerment, both locally and internationally.
HH Sheikha Fatima's honouring is an international appreciation certificate for the UAE that has set a role model to be followed for the whole world in women's empowerment, the officials underlined.
Commenting on the achievement, the officials told the Emirates News Agency "WAM" that the honouring is a recognition of the great contributions of the Mother of the Emirates over the years in promoting women's role in the UAE and the region. Such contributions were celebrated at regional and international levels, the officials added.
For his part, Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, said that honouring of HH Sheikha Fatima Bint Mubarak symbolises the march of empowering Emirati women in education, excellence and innovation to contribute thereafter to boosting the nation's development and prosperity.
"Being chosen by the UN Women and the Global Partnerships Forum to win the award for leading women in the field of peace and security is a proof that Her Highness has been a champion in her humanitarian initiatives that were aimed to protect women and children at refugee camps and those fleeing from the adversities and consequences of wars around the world. It is also a recognition of Her Highness's leading role in the humanitarian activities of regional and international organisations," concluded Dr al Kaabi.
