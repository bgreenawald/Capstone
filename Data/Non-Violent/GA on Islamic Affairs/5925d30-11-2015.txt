With the upcoming celebrations of the 44th UAE National Day and Martyrs Day, the Abu Dhabi branch of Awqaf held a workshop marking these national celebrations. From its intellectual aspect, the workshop discussed promoting the religious awareness of the position of homeland and obedience to the ruler. It also discussed consolidating the national service culture and praising the achievements of the Union at all cultural, economic, educational and service levels.
At the beginning of this workshop, the participants congratulated the UAE wise leadership, citizens and residents on these two national events, calling to mind the efforts of the founding leader Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace, and the other founders who raised the banner of the Union with pride and dedication despite all the challenges until the UAE became nowadays a country of the happiest people and of highest development locally and regionally. They stressed that these gains were furthered under the leadership of the UAE President HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, may Allah protect him, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Emirates.
The workshop was exceptionally marked by the attendance by HE Dr Jamal Sanad al Suwaidi, Director General of the Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, and senior officials from both sides at the concluding session of the workshop at Abu Dhabi National Theatre.
Addressing Imams and Khateebs, Dr al Kaabi delivered a speech in which he welcomed Dr al Suwaidi and gave a synopsis about his recent book al Sarab (The Mirage), which is very famous in the Arab and global intellectual, official and political circles.
Dr al Kaabi thanked Dr al Suwaidi's attendance and initiative by presenting the Imams and Khateebs a hand-signed copy of the book each so as to be a significant enlightened religious discourse and critical political reference with a profound and comprehensive vision that showed to the Arab readers the false currents and ideologies using Islam as their cover to lure followers and the youth to what looked like a mirage.
For his part, Dr al Suwaidi expressed his delight about presenting his book to such a distinguished group of UAE intellectuals who have platforms of considerable effect on developing the culture of the community.
