The Haj preparation committee led by Mr Hamad Obeid al Zaabi, the Haj official delegation (OHD)'s vice chairman, left to Saudi Arabia to equip its offices in Mecca and Medina and do the necessary arrangements to receive pilgrims from UAE, including setting up the camps in Mina and Arafat.
The OHD chairman, Mr Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, said that the committee will hand over the tents in Mina and Arafat and start equipping them as necessary, adding that operators should proceed with registering pilgrims in the Haj system for the committee to be able to provide its services to them in the best possible way.
For the same purpose, Mr al Mazrouei urged the committee to work as a team and do their best for catering to the needs of pilgrims in line with the directives of HH Sheikh Khalifa, the President of UAE, may Allah protect him, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Rulers of the Emirates, Members of the Supreme Court, and HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.
Mr al Mazrouei also highlighted the special interest of HE Dr Hamdan Musallam al Mazrouei, the Awqaf's chairman, and HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, the Awqaf's director general, in developing the services provided by the OHD.
On another note, HE Ahmed Mohammed Mankoush, the UAE Consul in Jeddah, visited the OHD's offices in Mecca and briefed on its programmes and plans and asked about what kind of assistance the Consulate could bring to the official delegation in undertaking its mission. Mr Mankoush later toured the OHD's and pilgrims' camps in Mina and Arafat.
