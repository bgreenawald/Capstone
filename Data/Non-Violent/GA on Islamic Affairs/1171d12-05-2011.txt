Registration can be either done through travel agents for Hajj, or directly through GAIAE website. To register directly, pilgrim is to click on "pilgrims information" page on GAIAE website to enter his/her personal information for registration. GAIAE started accepting pilgrims' registration on the 1st of May, 2011.
 
There are no new rules or regulations relating to potential pilgrims this year. Registered pilgrims will be informed promptly of any new Saudi rules and regulations relating to required documentation or visa issuance.
It is to be noted that there were 10500 pilgrims from the UAE in 2010. The Official Hajj Convoy offered free health care to all UAE pilgrims .A  medical committee was in charge of preventing the spread of any contagious diseases during pilgrimage. Each Hajj convoy was accompanied by at least a physician and a nurse. The number of both physicians and nurses is proportionate to the number of pilgrims to offer the best health care services. Special care was also available for pilgrims with chronic diseases who required medical follow up or hospitalization.
