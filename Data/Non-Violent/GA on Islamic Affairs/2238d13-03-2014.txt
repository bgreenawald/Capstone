As part of its strategic plan concerning the development of Waqf assets following the best investment practices, Awqaf has received Hamil Khadim al Ghait endowment. The building, one of the latest real estate endowments in Abu Dhabi, was immediately placed for investment and its revenues for various Waqf expenditures.
HE Dr Hamdan Musallam al Mazrouei, Awqaf's chairman, who received the building, said that it was a new charitable addition to Islamic Waqf assets in UAE. He was accompanied by HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's director general, the executive directors and HE Ghait bin Hamil Khadim al Ghait al Qubaisi.
Dr al Mazrouei takes this opportunity to hail the continuous support of the wise leadership to Awqaf and its various projects.
He also praised the contribution of the business community, companies and institutions that join Awqaf in building real estate endowments which serve large segments of UAE society in many areas from education, health to humanitarian efforts.
For his part, Mr Ghait bin Hamil said that he was glad that the Islamic Affairs would take the responsibility of managing the property as it has the necessary expertise and capability to invest in endowments and channel their income to fund Waqf expenditures.
The building is an endowment by an Emirati philanthropist: the late Hamil al Ghait, who donated the land plot. Awqaf has built it following new residential designs and fit it with the best facilities and utilities. The five-storey building lies on an area of 334,45 sqm and consists of two showrooms, three offices in the mezzanine and 15 apartments. Each apartment is composed of two bedrooms and a hall.  It is worth mentioning that the building has already been leased and it is expected to generate an annual revnue of up to AED 1,500,000.
