 The General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (GAIAE) signed an agreement with an engineering consultant to develop the necessary studies and draw designs for the construction of two mosques in Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Quawain. The two mosques are part of the Mafhas Al Qatah (the dove nest) programme, with a capacity of 1000 and 1300 worshippers respectively. Both mosques will have the necessary facilities adjacent to it, including a house for  imam and muezzin.
Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, GAIAE's Director General, said that the Awqaf Authority will continue building, renovating and caretaking of mosques. These efforts are in line with the instructions of the wise UAE leadership, which place great emphasis on mosques and recognise their  important role in society.
"These two mosques are the fruit of the Mafhas Al Qatah programme that Awqaf  launched two years ago, and the donations collected have contributed to building a number of mosques across UAE. The programme is widely welcome by the public, and  will continue," said Dr Al Kaabi,
