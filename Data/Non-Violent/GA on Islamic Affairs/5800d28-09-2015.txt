Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman, has affirmed that no "one-week" Hajj will be approved this year, noting that there is no room for accepting new Hajj applications as the number of the UAE pilgrims has already reached the quota approved by the Saudi authorities.
Dr Al Kaabi noted that the Hajj packages offered by Hajj operators varied between AED 30,000 to 40,000 per person.
