A total of 134 new mosques were opened across the UAE last year.  The highest rate of new mosques was in Al Ain City where 32 mosques were built in addition to the existing ones, followed by the Emirate of Umm Al Quwain, where 25 mosques were built and opened, Sharjah with a total of 18 mosques and Abu Dhabi City and outskirts where 17 mosques were inaugurated.  Fujairah came next with 13 new mosques, 10 in Ajman, 9 in Ras Al Khaimah, 5 in Khor Fakkan and 5 in the Western Region in Abu Dhabi.
Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, underlined the great attention paid by the UAE leaders to mosques, which they rendered amongst the most remarkable landmarks of the UAE.
Dr al Kaabi stated that the UAE leaders' generous support to mosques construction in the country brought it to such a sophisticated level that has become a source of pride to the UAE and the Islamic world alike.
"Mosques have become beacons of righteousness and signs of guidance, thanks to the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace, who laid down the foundations of benevolence and generosity, and to the UAE leaders, headed by the UAE President HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who followed in his steps," added Dr al Kaabi, praying to Allah the Almighty to have mercy upon Sheikh Zayed and grant success to his sons.
Dr al Kaabi said that the UAE leaders' special interest in mosques had made the UAE a model to emulate by other Muslim countries.
On this occasion, al Kaabi extended his sincerest gratitude to HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan for his massive support to mosques in the UAE.
"Such a sophisticated status in mosques sector imposes bigger challenges and responsibilities on Awqaf so as to sustain it in way to meet aspirations of the UAE's wise leaders," Dr al Kaabi concluded.
