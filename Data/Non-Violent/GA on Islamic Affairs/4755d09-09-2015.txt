Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman, said that the UAE Official Fatwa Centre answered more than 73,000 calls and text messages during the Holy month of Ramadan.
Dr Al Kaabi said the centre continued to receive Fatwas at the weekends via SMS, aiming to answer the public's questions about rulings related to fasting, first day of Eid and Eid prayers. He noted that Awqaf had received positive feedback regarding services offered.
Dr Al Kaabi attributed the rise in calls frequency to the public's trust in the centre and its services, being the official centre and the scholarly reference authority on the matter. He also attributed the centre's prompt response to its large archive of Fatwas which were categorised according to a clear approach that would help their retrieval when needed.
Awqaf is also using the latest technologies to serve religious issues in order to implement its vision and make it easier for the public to learn about their religious matters, he added.  
Dr Al Kaabi explained that the centre aimed to offer righteous and moderate judgments to people from all walks of life, highlighting that Awqaf is the official entity entrusted by the UAE wise leadership to assume such a task. For this purpose, it is staffed with elite scholars to answer religious questions from members of the public, concluded Dr Al Kaabi.
