More than 337,000 Fatwas were issued last year by the Official Fatwa Centre, being an increase of about four thousand in comparison to the previous year.
In a statement, HE Dr Mohammed al Kaabi, Awqaf's director general, praised the wise leadership for their continuous support to the Centre. He then attributed such a significant performance to efforts by Awqaf in selecting the most qualified Muftis according to strict criteria and the special follow-up by HE Dr Hamdan Musallam al Mazrouei, who had directed senior Muftis to inspect on random basis the rendition of Fatwas to assure quality.
Fatwas over the phone reached about 250,000, while Fatwas through the website more than 8,000 up by around 5,000 and 1,000 Fatwas during 2012 respectively. Fatwa via SMS also rose to about 57,000, up by just about 2000 Fatwas.
Since its inception in 2008, the Centre has released approximately two million Fatwas.
