Dear philanthropists
The General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments is pleased to invite you  to donate to our various types of Waqf and endowment projects. Waqf is a continuing charity with long-lasting positive outcome and this is your opportunity to donate and gain reward. Allah's Messenger Muhammad pbuh said, "when a man dies all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (Sadaqah Jariyah), beneficial knowledge and a righteous son who prays for him".
