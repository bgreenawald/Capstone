The General Authority for Islamic Affairs and Endowments launched the English version of its website. Dr.Mohammad Mattar Alkaabi, GAIAE Director General, who made the announcement, stated that this decision was based on the tremendous interest in GAIAE website, both locally and internationally, and to help non-Arabic website visitors benefit from GAIAE services including GAIAE news, Friday sermons, fatawa archives, suggestions and recommendations, articles from Manar Al-Islam magazine, information on Islam in addition to other helpful services.
Dr.Alkaabi added that GAIAE received many suggestions and recommendations in this regard, noting that launching the English version was based on the recommendation of GAIAE Board of Directors. One of the major benefits of GAIAE website is "that it is a government interactive website on the local and international levels."
GAIAE Director General also announced that a new website service has been introduced in both Arabic and English. Thanks to this service, no need to resort to conventional means such as inquiring about GAIAE services via the phone or by visiting GAIAE premises. GAIAE website now offers comprehensive information about each GAIAE service (description, status, type, how to access it, office hours, required documentation, terms and conditions, fees, location and phone numbers)
It is to be noted that GAIAE Department of Information Technology played a valuable role in designing the website. The IT Department adhered to the criteria and instructions stated in the guide for government websites and conformed to ISO-W3C rules and specifications.
