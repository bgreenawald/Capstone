In response to the initiative launched by the Martyrs' Families' Affairs Office at the Court of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, Awqaf observed a minute of silent prayer in honour of the UAE's noble martyrs.
Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, as well as all of Awqaf's officials, male and female employees across the country joined the nation in the one minute honouring. The UAE flag, which was flying half-mast as a mark of respect to the martyrs, was, then, raised accompanied with the national anthem.
Commenting on the occasion, Dr al Kaabi hailed the initiative as a sign of care given by the UAE's wise leadership to the nation's martyrs in loyalty and gratitude to their sacrifices in the way of defending the country, preserving its achievements and supporting the oppressed against the oppressors.
"Declaring November 30 of each year as Martyrs' Day is an initiative that is conducive to nurture the love of the nation in the hearts of the generations, teach them to sacrifice all that is precious in defence and protection of it and be loyal to its leadership," Dr al Kaabi added.
Marking the occasion, Awqaf called on its mosques' Imams and Khateebs, preachers, Muftis and all of its employees across the country to interact with such generous patriotic initiative that shows solidarity with the martyrs' families and contributes to imparting tranquillity to their hearts.
