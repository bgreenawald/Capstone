The UAE official Hajj mission has left the UAE via Abu Dhabi International Airport for Saudi Arabia to serve the UAE pilgrims in the holy places. Its tasks include following up the pilgrims' movements and accommodation in Mecca and Medina, supervising their conditions, building their camps in the holy sites, planning their travel to Mina and Arafat in co-ordination with the Saudi concerned authorities and providing the best services that may help them perform Hajj easily and smoothly until they return to the homeland.
HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman and Head of the UAE Official Hajj Mission, instructed the mission members to work diligently and be the best ambassadors for serving their compatriots in this great season - as was the case in every season. He also instructed them to work round the clock to reach each Emirati pilgrim, check if everything was fine with them and show the attention paid to them by the prudent leadership, enabling them to perform Hajj completely and in the correct way as per the Islamic law.
Commenting on the occasion, Dr Al Kaabi said, "As we are now leaving our homeland, we pray to Allah the Almighty to continue blessing HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE President, with good health and to grant success to HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and Their Highnesses Rulers of the Emirates, for the glory and prosperity of our country."
"We also pray to Allah, the Most Exalted, to have mercy upon our founding leader late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan and our martyrs who sacrificed their lives to defend their country, leadership and regional and global peace. As Hajj is a season to highlight the people's aspirations for co-operation and safe and peaceful co-existence, we hope that stability and peace will prevail in our Arab and Islamic world and in the rest countries of the world. We also wish that Hajj will be a civilised faith-based message that reflects the peace and stability that our true religion calls for, away from extremism and terrorism," Dr al Kaabi added.
Concluding his statement, Dr al Kaabi said, "We are leaving for Saudi Arabia with all our appreciation to its people and prudent leadership for all the services and facilities they are providing to pilgrims and for the special long ties between both our leaderships and peoples in terms of religion, blood and bright future for Arabs, Muslims and the world."
