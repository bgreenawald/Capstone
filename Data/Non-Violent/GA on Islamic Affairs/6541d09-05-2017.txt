Awqaf's training centre for preparing Imams and Khateebs completed the second training course for Sudanese Imams and Khateebs who came from Sudan to learn about Awqaf's experience in authenticating and developing modern religious discourse and discuss matters related to latest jurisprudence (Fiqh) matters, combatting extremist ideologies and surmounting challenges facing contemporary Muslim communities in terms of theory and practice.
HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, along with HE Mohammed al Ameen al Karib, Ambassador of Sudan to the UAE, honoured the participating Sudanese Imams and Khateebs and granted them appreciation certificates.
On the occasion, Dr al Kaabi delivered a brief speech in which he pointed out the development of distinguished relationships between the wise leaderships of the brotherly Sudan and the UAE, welcoming the audience and hailing the cooperation extended by the Sudanese embassy in Abu Dhabi as well as the generosity of the people of Sudan and their authentic religious and patriotic loyalty.
Dr al Kaabi further stressed that this training course translated on ground the efforts aimed at strengthening the fraternal relationships between both countries and exchanging expertise, researches and experiences amongst those who are concerned with religious affairs, both scholarly and practically.
"We were very delighted to receive you in your second country so as to closely see the features of the UAE's modern renaissance and to learn about the development of the religious discourse, its authenticity, objectives and terminology used by Awqaf. It has been an opportunity as well to gain knowledge about Awqaf's approach in controlling Fatwa issuance, Friday sermons, and lessons at mosques in accordance with scientific and profound grounds and in line with an annual preaching plan that is based on authenticity, harmony with modern age and openness to global culture. Moreover, it was also a good chance to understand the intellectual challenges that face the illuminated and moderate religious discourse and mechanisms to promote such discourse through media channels, both the traditional and the smart digital ones," Dr al Kaabi underlined.
Addressing the audience, Dr al Kaabi concluded his speech saying, "I place my trust in you to discharge the responsibility of developing the Islamic religious discourse and be open to all that which may be conducive to cement compassion and peaceful co-existence amongst peoples of the world in accordance with the approach of moderation and tolerance that you have touched in the UAE society, mosques as well as all the sites that you have visited in the country where you experienced the civilised model of co-existence amongst all cultures existing in it."
