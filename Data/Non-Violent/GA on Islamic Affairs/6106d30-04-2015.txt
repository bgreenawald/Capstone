Awqaf branch in Fujairah denied the news published in the Al Ittihad Newspaper on 29 April, 2015 that there were no national Muezzins assigned to call Adhan across the emirate.
The branch explained that 30 nationals so far were working as Khateebs, Imams and Adhan callers in the Awqaf's mosques across the residential areas in Fujairah.
These nationals adhered to the official sermon issued by Awqaf, called Adhan for Friday prayers, acted as Imams and gave daily mosque lessons as per the plan approved by the Preaching Department at Awqaf, the branch added.
The branch affirmed that Awqaf was carrying on its efforts to Emiratise these professions by adding and establishing a set of privileges and incentives based on its strategic plan.
