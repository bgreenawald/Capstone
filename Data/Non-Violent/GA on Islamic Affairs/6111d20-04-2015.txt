Sheikh Abdullah Bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, director of Awqaf branch in Sharjah, warned of the dangers of the destructive Takfiri ideology and its harmful impacts on the society.
The Takfiri doctrine is based on a perverse and misleading ideology that the society should combat and protect the youth against, Sheikh al Qasimi said, stressing the importance of concerted efforts to promote the performance of those in charge of the Emirate's mosques, motivate them to seek the Sharia knowledge, hone their skills and develop their cultures in view of the role they play in the society.
This came on the sidelines of an awareness lecture titled "The dangers of Takfir", which was organized by the Awqaf branch in Sharjah for the Emirate's Imams and Muezzins at the Al-Maghfirah Mosque in the al-Seef District. The lecture was given by Sheikh Ahmed Mohammed Hashim, a preacher from Awqaf and member of the Fatwa standing committee.
