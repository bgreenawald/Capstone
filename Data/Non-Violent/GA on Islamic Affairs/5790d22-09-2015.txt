HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf chairman and head of the UAE hajj mission, was briefed on the preparations made by all committees accompanying the UAE Hajj Mission after arriving to Mecca and Medina. The committees have commenced their official duties in preparation for receiving the UAE Hajj campaigns.
Dr Al Kaabi said that the UAE's Hujjaj Affairs Office seeks to provide pilgrims with the best services in line with directives of the UAE wise leadership to deal with any obstacles that pilgrims may face and ensure for them a safe pilgrimage.
He noted that all preparations by the committees in Mecca and Medina have been completed, including medical and media committees, tent committees in Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifah, as well as Financial, IT, public relations, supporting services, complaints, contract supervision and auditing committees.
Dr Al Kaabi also noted that  preparation tents in Mina were almost done and they were being provided with the best means and services to host the UAE pilgrims. The UAE mission premises are fitted with surveillance cameras and electronic gates. Electricity generators are supplied in Mina, Arafat and Muzdalifah. More air-conditioners and fans were installed, added Dr Al Kaabi.
Al Kaabi further noted that preaching and Fatwa services will be provided to the UAE pilgrims around the clock as preachers and Muftis can be reached over the phone.
