Awqaf was prepared for the anticipated extensive flow of calls to its Official Fatwa Centre during Ramadan 1437 AH, succeeding to answer around 80589 questions, an estimated increase of 7000 Fatwas compared to last year. The Fatwas answered questions about jurisprudence of worship, business transactions and women-specific matters.
On the occasion, Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, said that thanks to the support by the UAE's wise leadership, the Official Fatwa Centre, has become a point of interest and gained the trust of the public inside and outside the country.
"Awqaf had to increase the Centre's capabilities in terms of scientific research and Fiqh competences in order to meet the requirements of people and offer them righteous and moderate judgements in a an easy manner," Dr al Kaabi added.
He noted that the Centre continued receiving Fatwas during the Eid official holidays until the first day of Eid. It also answered people's questions at the weekends via SMS during the holy month. Fatwas were released as well via the Awqaf's accounts on social media platforms, Dr al Kaabi further underlined.
Dr al Kaabi concluded by announcing that as a preparation for the upcoming Hajj season, Awqaf has laid down a plan to offer Fatwa services before and during the performance of the pilgrimage rites.
