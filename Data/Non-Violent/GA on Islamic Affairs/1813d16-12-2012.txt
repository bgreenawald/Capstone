Under the auspices of HH Sheikha Wadima bint Zayed Al Nahyan, the foundation stone was laid for a new Quranic memorisation centre in Umm Ghafa in the Eastern Region, Al Ain.
Mariam bint Sultan Centre will occupy an area of 6000 sqm. The construction will include the renovation of the old centre, which will be turned into a complex comprising a mosque, a centre for teaching Quran, cultural and lectures halls, as well as a large charity market. It is expected to open by next holy month of Ramadan.
The establishment of the new centre is part of the keen interest of the wise leadership to provide the best of services to the rural and urban areas. It also falls in the framework of Awqaf's strategy to develop model Quranic centres meeting advanced educational standards.
Present during the foundation stone-laying ceremony were Prof Dr Farouk Hamada, the religious advisor at Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Court, Mr Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, the executive director for Islamic affairs, and Mr Abdul Aziz al Ghaithi, Awqaf branch's director in Al Ain.
