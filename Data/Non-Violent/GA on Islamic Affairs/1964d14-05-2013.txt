In the framework of its social responsibility, the government communication department at Awqaf organised a lecture on autism at its headquarter in Abu Dhabi. This initiative was held in coordination with Zayed Higher Organisation for Humanitarian Care and Special Needs- Abu Dhabi Centre for Autism.
This event was part of efforts to raise awareness regarding people with special needs by highlighting scientific facts and other various factors conducive to integrating autists into society. It also aimed to suggest ways to help this segment of people develop their skills and talents so as to become productive.
The lecture was delivered by Ms Khawla al Shehhi from Abu Dhabi Centre for Autism and attended by Awqaf staff. Ms al Shehhi explained ways to diagnose the autism in its early stage, the role of the family, and the importance of interacting positively with the patient.  She said it is highly recommended to admit a person with autism symptoms to a specialised centre, noting that autism is of different types.
She also pointed out that Abu Dhabi Centre for Autism dealt individually with each case based on scientific methods and ran rehabilitation programmes.
It is worth mentioning that Awqaf has widely addressed this issue through Friday sermons, lectures in mosques and various community institutions
