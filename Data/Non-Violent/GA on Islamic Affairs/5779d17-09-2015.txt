During a meeting of the emotional support team for martyrs' families and Armed Forces, HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf's chairman, reviewed the plan's executive programme. The plan aims to provide the necessary moral support to the martyrs' families, enhance faith and religious awareness in the Emirati society for positive response to the Armed Forces' missions in Yemen, as well as reinforce the values of loyalty to the homeland and its wise leadership. The plan also warns against the circulation of rumours that affect the security and stability of the nation.
Dr Al Kaabi said that the plan highlighted several topics, including the role of the martyrs of the nation and their status in this life and the next, defending the UAE, maintaining its safety and stability, the religious, national and humanitarian position of the Armed Forces, the close relationship between UAE rulers and its people and the cooperation among the GCC states to defend the legitimate rights of the Yemeni people.
Dr Al Kaabi praised, on this occasion, the role of preachers who were present during the funeral of the martyrs, and consoled their families during the funerals. He instructed the emotional support team to supervise lessons, sermons and seminars held at mosques throughout the UAE during September and ensure their topics are in line with the plan's objectives. He also urged preachers to use social media channels to interact with the public.
