GCC Hujjaj affairs' offices decided to set up a joint-committee to be tasked with taking suitable measures against Hajj campaigns which had violated the regulations during this year's pilgrimage season.
The announcement was made by Mr Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, head of the UAE Hujjaj affairs' office, following his participation in the annual meeting convened in Mecca and gathered similar offices in the GCC countries.
"Forming this committee, a part of the GCC Hujjaj affairs' offices, aims at establishing procedures for combating the breach of law by some campaigns, a phenomenon that has increased in recent years. Some of the violations included issuing forged Hajj permits," said al Mazrouei.
He added that the meeting discussed also a number of procedures which were meant to enhance services offered by Hujjaj affairs' offices, namely training qualified GCC cadres in all areas related to Hajj management.
"Additionally, the meeting looked into challenges during Hajj season, proposed solutions and planned for improving the services given to pilgrims of the GCC countries," concluded al Mazrouei.
