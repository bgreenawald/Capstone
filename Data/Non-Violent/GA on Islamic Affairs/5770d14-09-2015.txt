Awqaf board of directors decided in its sixth meeting this year to allocate AED 15 million to demolish and rebuild 15 mosques in Ras Al Khaimah.
At the beginning of the meeting, Dr Al Kaabi expressed his condolences and feelings of pride to the UAE wise leadership, the Armed Forces, the UAE people and families of martyrs who fell while performing their national duty in Yemen. He prayed to Allah to confer His mercy upon them and gather them with the prophets, steadfast affirmers of truth, the martyrs and the righteous. Dr Al Kaabi further prayed to Allah to protect UAE's brave soldiers in Yemen, grant them victory and perpetuate safety, security and stability to the UAE. He also expressed his gratitude to the board of directors for their diligent follow up on the progress of work at Awqaf branches.
Dr Al Kaabi said that the board of directors aspire to reach the goals of the UAE's wise leadership, stressing that their work complements the efforts by Awqaf's staff to achieve its strategy plan.
The board approved the 2016 federal budget for Awqaf and further discussed Awqaf's preparation for the Hajj season, travel arrangements, and the departure of the official hajj mission. The board also emphasised that Awqaf is working on implementing the directives of the UAE wise leadership by providing all means of comfort to the Emirati pilgrims, including supervising the setup of tents in Mina and Arafat, increasing electric load capacity to accommodate new AC units in the UAE pilgrims' tents. Special arrangements are made this year to ensure secure entry and exit of pilgrims at the camps, the board said.
