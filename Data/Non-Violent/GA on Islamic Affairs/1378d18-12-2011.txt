Mosques in the UAE will see new and modern developments, said Dr. Mohammed Matar Salem Al Kaabi, Director General of the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (GAIAE). The Authority is keen to specifically introduce more community-based services that benefit  individuals and increase mosques' role, besides being a place of worship.
 This came during his  opening of the "Our Mosques in the UAE"  exhibition held at the GAIAE's  general headquarters in Abu Dhabi last  Wednesday, which was  attended by Mr. Mohamed Obeid Al Mazrouei, the GAIAE's Executive Director for Islamic Affairs, Mr.  Hamad Yusuf Mualla, the GAIAE's Executive Director for Religious   Endowments (awqaf) Affairs in addition to other senior officials.
Dr Al Kaabi said that the UAE will see in the coming years mosques of unique architectural designs with buildings that are environmentally-friendly. The GAIAE has already installed solar energy systems in some mosques in Abu Dhabi.
"The urban development and creative designs of mosques in the UAE are a clear evidence of the special care given by our wise leadership to houses of worship. Prayer caravans, for example, were removed and replaced by mosques in order to give the latter the attention and care befitting the sanctity of a place of worship.
"The children's centre that opened at the  Sheikha Fatima  bint Mubarak  Mosque in Mohammed bin Zayed City has also been welcomed by everyone especially women. That will prompt us to provide more services that benefit the community," added Dr. Al Kaabi.
The Exhibition displayed  a selection of photographs of mosques in the UAE as part of a contest launched by the GAIAE earlier. One thousand photos were submitted by competitors which showed old and new mosques across the UAE.
