Dr.AlKaabi, GAIAE director general, announced the completion of Sheikha Salama mosque project in Al-Ain which will be officially inaugurated this month.
GAIAE director general stressed the importance of the mosque in view of its special historical value and the fact that it is the largest mosque in Al-Ain. It will be a civilization landmark and a touristic attraction in Al-Wahat City. Dr. AlKaabi added that GAIAE is keen to having an opening ceremony that commensurate with the marvelous mosque as one of the key Islamic icons in the city.
Project building cost was 105 million dirhams. The new mosque  has an area of 5900 square meters. It can accommodate 4850 worshippers including a women prayer room for 650 females. The mosque is equipped with state-of-the-art automatic air conditioning service, the first of its kind in the city. It is also equipped with a modern lighting system with color changing effect in special religious occasions such as Ramadan and religious holidays. The window design maximizes the diffusion of natural light. The mosque has a lighting system that gradually increases the light level as we approach the mihrab.
The architectural design of the mosque blends the modern with the traditional. It is in harmony with the surrounding traditional features. The mosque exterior color is quasi similar to the sand color in Al-Ain desert.
Housing for the imam and the muezzin are adjacent to the mosque. The mosque provides parking for 200 cars which seems disproportionate with the capacity of the mosque. However, as the mosque is located in the souk area, a study estimated that 80% of the worshippers will walk to the mosque.
