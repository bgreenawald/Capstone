Awqaf has recently held the fifth meeting of its board of directors this year, which has received new members: HE Dr Omar Abdul Rahman al Nuaimi, HE Dr Mohammed Atiq al Falahi, HE Ali Khalfan al Mansoori and HE Mariam Mohammed al Rumaithi. It was presided over by Awqaf chairman, HE Dr Hamdan Musallam al Mazrouei.
Dr al Mazrouei praised the trust of the UAE leadership in the new board and the support it gives to Awqaf and its endowment, service and social programmes. He said that the board was set to promote Awqaf's mission and vision aiming at spreading authentic Islamic values and addressing any deviations from principles of moderation, adding that it would highlight the national identity in areas of jurisprudence, Fatwa and preaching.
He said this is a pledge, which Awqaf is committed to before Allah the Exalted and HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, their brothers Their Highness, Members of the Supreme Council, Rulers of the Emirates, and HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
On this occasion, Dr al Mazrouei thanked members of the former members, and praised their efforts in improving and developing Awqaf. The board approved the construction of a new pedestrian bridge in Ajman linking a mosque and a residential area and named new mosques after people who served the country as a tribute for them.
The board also agreed to build the Awqaf branch's building in Abu Dhabi, which will serve the capital, the new town and cities, as well as the budget for maintaining two endowment buildings in Sharjah Emirate and building a mosque in Murror area in Abu Dhabi. It also decided to provide grants for needy pilgrim hopefuls from some Arab countries, and finally recommended ways to increase Waqf investments and adjust the situation of some employees.
