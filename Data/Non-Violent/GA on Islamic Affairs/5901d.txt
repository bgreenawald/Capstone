The Sharjah Islamic Affairs Branch has organised a seminar titled "Mosque's mission in building societal peace" at Al Maghfira Mosque. The seminar, which came as part of HH the UAE President's Guest Scholars Programme during the holy month of Ramadan, was delivered by Prof. Dr. Hesham Tahtah of the Kingdom of Morocco and was attended by Sharjah City's Imams and Muezzins.
During the seminar, the lecturer talked about some rules and ethics to be followed in mosques as well as the importance of mosques in Islam and their value in Muslim societies as oases of knowledge, peace of mind and tranquility, noting that originally a person who entered a mosque used to be safe and secure but is scared and on the alert in some countries nowadays. He underscored the need to confront extreme ideas by understanding Islam correctly.
The lecturer also stressed the importance and legitimacy of the Waqf (endowment) for making people closer to Allah. At the end, the lecturer praised the attention paid by the UAE and its prudent leadership to mosques in terms of building, sponsorship and cleaning and also as an endowment, noting that this was one of the exploits of the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah have mercy upon him, and the subsequent Rulers of the Emirates, may Allah grant them success and save them.
For his part, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Director of Sharjah Islamic Affairs Branch, praised the guest's proper guidance and beneficial knowledge given to those working in mosques, stressing the importance of the key role played by Awqaf in recruiting scholars and preachers from various Islamic countries to benefit from their scientific and practical expertise in the areas of awareness and guidance.
