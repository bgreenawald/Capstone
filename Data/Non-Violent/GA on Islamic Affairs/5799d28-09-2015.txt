In an effort to ensure the safety of pilgrims, the UAE Official Hajj Mission has conducted an awareness workshop for its members on rapid evacuation of buildings and camps in case of fire and other emergency incidents.
The workshop demonstrated ways of ensuring safety of pilgrims and briefed the heads of committees on their roles in educating pilgrims of the necessity to abide by the guidelines given to them to maintain their safety. Awareness leaflets that included civil defence guidelines were also distributed. Additional awareness activities have also been intensified inside the camps at Mina and Arafat, where the committee members co-ordinate with the Hajj mission to raise the level of preventive awareness amongst pilgrims.
Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman and the head of the Official Hajj Mission, said the specialised committee accompanying Hajj mission had been carefully selected to ensure safety of the UAE's pilgrims since they arrive in Saudi Arabia and until they leave back to the UAE. Also, Dr Al Kaabi underscored the role of awareness campaigns in maintaining safety of pilgrims and their property.
