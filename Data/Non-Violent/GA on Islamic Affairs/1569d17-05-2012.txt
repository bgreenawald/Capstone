A meeting of the committees responsible for the programme of Scholars, guests of the UAE President HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan was held to discuss the necessary preparations for next Ramadan.
The meeting was presided over by HE Dr Hamadan Musallam al Mazrouei, the GAIAE's Chairman, and was attended by  HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, the GAIAE's Director General, the executive directors in addition to heads of committees responsible for the programme.
Dr al Mazrouei praised the keen interest of HH Sheikh Khalifa, the UAE president, may Allah protect him, in preparing early for the Holy Ramadan. The purpose is to make of this month a time for mercy, social interaction, and an occasion to reflect upon the deep meanings of the Holy Quran and foster the spirit of faith in society.
Dr al Mazrouei looked into  the action plan, tasks and needs of  committees involved in the programme. He also reviewed various suggestions that would contribute to its success at the level of institutions, forums and mosques. These include devising the time schedule of lectures and their topics and determining the need of the community in this regard.
The Ministry of Presidential Affairs and the GAIAE have joined efforts to invite an elite of scholars and thinkers to give lectures during Ramadan.
It is worth mentioning that the UAE President's guests programme is continuing and is growing year after year.
