Awqaf opened Ali Al Belushi Mosque on the Abu Dhabi - Dubai highway in presence of big host of people from Al Samha West, Mr. Ali Mohammed Sadiq al Belushi, a philanthropist in the year of giving on the land of giving, and Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman.
On the Abu Dhabi - Dubai highway travelers cherish the highest level of services, especially such mosques which have been constructed on the international highways. Through such mosques, Awqaf strives to touch the travelers' hearts with happiness by allowing them to establish their prayers in a tranquil atmosphere featuring the beauty of Islamic architecture.
The new mosque is considered as one of the distinctive cultural landmarks on the highway between Dubai and the capital Abu Dhabi. It is located in the old al Samha West area. Thanks to such landmarks, the road acquires a spiritual aesthetic touch that highlights the great urban development in terms of mosque construction. The mosque accommodates for around 2000 worshipers in addition to all other primary attachments, such as women Musalla, other facilities, accommodation for Imam and Muezzen.
The mosque features modern architecture in terms of its pyramidal ceiling that rises upwards to end with a magnificent dome. On its sides stand two unique eminent minarets. Meanwhile, the interior of the mosque preserves the basic elements in mosque construction, including the Mihrab (niche), the pulpit and the prayer hall. All those components keep in pace with the urban planning of the modern cities, industrial, commercial and tourist facilities that are planned to be constructed on the Abu Dhabi - Dubai highway.
