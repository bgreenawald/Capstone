He added that contractors had finished the construction works and Awqaf was currently fitting the mosques with carpets, air-conditioning equipment and so on.
Ajman branch is keeping contact with donors who wish to build or maintain mosques, by providing means to promote community engagement, said al Zaabi who also explained that the need for building mosques would continue in parallel with the urban expansion in the Emirate. He said that Awqaf branch has land plots for this purpose and are available throughout areas which need new mosques.
Awqaf branch is currently replacing old air-conditioning units in many mosques and providing bukhoor and fragrance in mosques for use during Ramdan.
In the run up to Ramadan, a meeting was held with Imams and Kateebs on how to best serve mosques during the holy month of Ramadan. They were advised to come earlier before prayers and make mosques ready for prayers by making sure they are clean and perfumed and air-conditioning system works properly.
