Awqaf's website attracted around 5.4 million visits in 2015, an estimated increase of over 100 per cent compared to 2014, in which the website recorded 2.63 million visits.
The number of page visits also saw a remarkable rise at 4 million, being an increase of approximately 111 per cent over 2014 when the website received around 2 million hits. Visitors of the website come from 218 countries around the world.
HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, said, "this steady rise in the number of users of the Awqaf's website is due to several factors including credibility and public trust in the moderate religious discourse adhered to by the UAE, which is the state of tolerance, moderation and respect of peoples' cultures and civilisations, this being the essence of authenticity and modernity."
Another factor lies in the regular update of the website's content in both Arabic and English and addition of new electronic services that ensured users quick and effective access, Dr al Kaabi added.
Awqaf also launched an updated user-friendly version with stronger structure to achieve a positive interaction with users through multiple channels of communication.
The website always holds advanced positions among national and regional websites. In 2015, an assessment of the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority classified it among the distinguished categories, scoring 97 per cent overall.
