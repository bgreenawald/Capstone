Discussion of pending issues and regulating work mechanism were the main issues tackled by the first GAIAE workshop this year. The workshop, which was held at GAIAE premises, was headed by H.E.Dr.Mohammad Matar AlKaabi, GAIAE director general and attended by all GAIAE offices and departments directors.
H.E. GAIAE director general extended his appreciation to UAE prudent leadership for the continuous support for GAIAE efforts to instill ethical and religious values and promote and increase awqaf revenues. Dr.Al-Kaabi added that these endeavors are in line with GAIAE strategic plan approved by the cabinet.
GAIAE entrusted the directors of GAIAE offices to provide imams and mue'zzins (performing calls to prayer) working in old mosques with convenient accommodations this year, given the fact that old mosques don't not have adjacent homes. Such endeavor must be achieved in coordination with the Awqaf Department and Municipalities.
Further, all mosques personnel are required to end their vacations one week prior to Ramadan.
In the framework of improving the performance of both imams and mu'ezzins, it has been decided to:
Conduct contexts in Quran memorization and excellence in Quran recitation for outstanding imams.
Hold training courses for imams whose performance may be improved.
Complete furnishing all UAE mosques.
The workshop discussed the preparations for the new term at the Quran Memorization Centers (four months term starting 16/1/2011). It is to be noted that there will be 367 sessions with an increase of 40 sessions over last year. Therefore, it is evident that GAIAE succeeded in attracting more students and promoting the interest in preserving Islamic identity.
The workshop was attended by GAIAE executive director for Islamic affairs, executive director for waqf affairs, executive director for support services as well as several GAIAE departments and offices directors.
