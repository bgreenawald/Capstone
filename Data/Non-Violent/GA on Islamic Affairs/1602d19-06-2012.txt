The General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments is preparing a suitable place that is compliant to the standards in force for hosting a child nursery, Hamad Yusuf Mualla, the executive director for support services, said.
All of the other arrangements have been made, including obtaining a licence from the ministry of social affairs and recruiting the administrative staff.
On this occasion, Mr Mualla praised the special support from the prudent UAE leadership aiming at improving the working conditions for female staff at government entities.
The preschool is part of the operational plan of the government communication department at the GAIAE, which has been welcomed by many members of staff and families who would like to see their children to be well taken care of close to their working mothers.
