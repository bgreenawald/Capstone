The General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (GAIAE) is committed to spreading a moderate religious culture modeled on modern international concepts. In doing so, it seeks to keep pace with the present time requirements and changes and to contribute to sustainable economic development by means of various Waqf disbursement channels. The aim is to cater to the various needs of the community to achieve social justice among its members, establish symbiotic social relations between employees and their families and improve their social conditions. The GAIAE also aims at providing a working environment that is free from any practices enticing any form of discrimination, including the employment or the support of employment of people under legal age or forced labour.
 The GAIAE took the initiative of introducing the requirements of the social responsibility policy (SRP) in all fields of its intervention. It also encourages its clients like Hajj travel agents and other suppliers to comply with the ethical standards as stipulated in the ISO SA 8000. In addition to the SRP'S implementation widely across all its departments, the GAIAE will also work on continuous improvement of the system related thereto, and periodically put it into use in conformity with the local and federal legislations as well as with the best international practices.
