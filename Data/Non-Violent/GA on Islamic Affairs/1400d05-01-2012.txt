 The General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (GAIAE) recently signed at the Awqaf's headquarters in Abu Dhabi a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) on  defining areas of cooperation relative to information security in line with the GAIAE's strategic plan for the last quarter of 2011.

Dr. Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, the GAIAE's Director General, signed the agreement on behalf of the Awqaf Authority,  while Mr. Mohammed Al Ghanim, CERT's Director General, signed on behalf of CERT.
As per the MoU, CERT will provide the IT Department at GAIAE with early warning and notification of threats and vulnerabilities. This is in order to facilitate the detection, prevention and response to the broader set of cyber security incidents  such as hacking, viruses and corruption on the Internet.
After signing the agreement, both sides toured  the Official Fatwa Centre and there was a briefing  on the latest IT technology  Muftis use. The Centre pioneered the use of  IT infrastructure in delivering fatwas  and interacting with the public.
Dr. Al Kaabi hailed the MoU, saying it will contribute effectively in addressing information security threats within GAIAE and its branches. It will also help promote the highly regarded moderate  approach to fatwa and the Islamic discourse as adopted by the prudent UAE leadership , he said.
