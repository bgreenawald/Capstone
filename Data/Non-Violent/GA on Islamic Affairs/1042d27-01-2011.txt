GAIAE is planning to launch an initiative to rationalize consumption in UAE mosques. The campaign aims at achieving  the optimal use of electricity and water resources in mosques and its annexes without compromising worshippers' convenience or  impairing the efficiency of equipment and devices.
HE Dr.AlKaabi, GAIAE Director General, said that this initiative aims at promoting societal culture of moderation in consumption, instilling the value of appreciation for Allah's blessings and participating in the preservation of these valuable resources. Dr.AlKaabi added that this campaign is in harmony with the UAE policy to rationalize consumption, thereby preserving resources and protecting the environment for sustainable development. He also noted that the implementation of this campaign entails conducting workshops for mosques personnel, distributing flyers and posters, placing ads in "Manar Al-Islam" magazine, installing new faucets and determining the usage times for both electricity and air conditioners.
