The UAE Official Fatwa Centre is playing a vital role in promoting the reference authority of the official Fatwa issuance in the UAE, said Mr Mohammed Obeid Al Mazrouei, Awqaf's Executive Director for Islamic Affairs.
On average, the centre receives 8,000 Fatwas daily in the holy month of Ramadan including around 7,000 Fatwas via phone and approximately 1,000 short text messages (SMS), he added.
Mr Al Mazrouei explained that outside Ramadan, Awqaf's scholars issued 1,200 to 1,300 Fatwas over phone, 300 text messages and up to 100 Fatwas by email on daily basis.
He noted that Awqaf stopped receiving requests for Fatwas through its website during the month of Ramadan as Muftis devoted themselves to answering the queries received over the phone and text messages as this covered the local need for Fatwas from inside the UAE.
Mr Al Mazrouei described the UAE Official Fatwa Centre as a leading innovative initiative and the first of its kind in the Islamic world.
The Centre is dedicated to issuing Fatwas that are aimed at consolidating the official issuance of Fatwas in the UAE, he said. To this end, Awqaf employed an elite group of Muftis with high academic credentials and known for their moderation. Awqaf also provided the technological tools to make it easy for members of the public to communicate with Muftis and at the same time animate radio and TV programmes that answer Fatwas, he said.
The centre employs as many as 55 male and female Muftis who offer Fatwas in three languages: Arabic, English and Urdu, Al Mazrouei said, adding that the Official Fatwa Centre provided several services, including the direct phone Fatwa service, SMS fatwa service and online.
