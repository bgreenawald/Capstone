 Implementing its policy with regards to the management of occupational health and safety,  the GAIAE's branch in Ajman conducted a "mock fire" evacuation in cooperation with the Ajman  Civil Defence Department. The drill is part of the GAIAE's efforts to create  an effective  internal system to manage crises by ensuring safety and security within its premises and by educating staff on how to handle such difficult situations.
Mr Obeid Hamad Al Zaabi, the Director of GAIAE's branch in Ajman, said that personnel had been briefed on the evacuation plan, types, necessary information to be provided in the evacuation order issued by the management as well as the categories of people of priority in addition to the preventive measures for members of the facility.
The staff were divided into  four main groups: first aid, reception, fire team and evacuation. Another three groups are in charge of  communication, media,  and the assembly point. Each group was instructed regarding its duties and obligations.
Mr Al Zaabi hailed the fast response of the operating room at the Civil Defence Department  to the communication by the GAIAE's branch. According to the notice, "the mock fire" broke out on 8:00 am. This prompted a civil Defence team led by Colonel Nasser Rashid Al Zerri, the Head of operations,  Lieutenant Abdul Aziz Al Dhahab, Director of operation branch, and First Assistant Jassim Al Jallaf, the Safety Officer, to intervene immediately. Two squad fire vehicles and ambulances were dispatched to deal with the simulated fire, and transferred "three injured persons" to the hospital for treatment.
"The drill will be reviewed to benefit from it. The ultimate aim is to meet the GAIAE's goal of establishing an effective internal system of managing crises and disasters, one that ensures safety and security for both personnel and the public at its premises," concluded Mr Al Zaabi.
