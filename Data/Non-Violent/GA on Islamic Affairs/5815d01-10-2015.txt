Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman, has inaugurated Late Hamad Suhail Al Kutbi Mosque in Al Ain in presence of a number of senior officials, dignitaries and a host of worshippers.
The mosque construction, featuring an authentic Islamic architecture, took 18 months to build and a cost of around AED 3,350,00. It accommodates up to 1000 worshippers and comprises a women's prayer room.
Dr Al Kaabi said that opening of this mosque, which is unique in its design, structure, fittings and facilities, came in line with the directives of the UAE wise leadership, headed by HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who are keenly interested in catering for the needs of mosques.
In a statement to Al Ittihad newspaper, Dr Al Kaabi stressed that the UAE leaders' special interest in mosques had made the UAE a model to emulate by other Islamic countries.
On this occasion, Dr Al Kaabi expressed his gratitude to HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, The UAE President, for his generous support to mosques construction in the country, bringing it to such a sophisticated level that became a source of pride.  
"Such a sophisticated status  in mosques sector, imposes bigger challenges and responsibilities on Awqaf so as to sustain it in way to meet aspirations of the UAE's wise leaders," Al Kaabi underlined.
