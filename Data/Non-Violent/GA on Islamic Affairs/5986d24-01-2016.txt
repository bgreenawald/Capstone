Awqaf has affirmed that al Imam al Jamia, a project with the aim of assigning Imams to supervise smaller mosques, was successfully implemented all over the UAE. It noted that the project was a new innovative initiative based on which one major mosque in every emirate would have its Imam be responsible for overseeing nearby mosques in order to accelerate delivery of administrative services, facilitate religious duties and support societal initiatives.
It is the first-of-its-kind initiative in the Muslim world and was hailed by several of its officials who have called for implementing similar projects in their countries, Awqaf stated.
On this occasion, Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, extended his deepest gratitude to HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, his brother HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, for their unlimited support to and interest in Awqaf's affairs.
"Al Imam al Jamia concept came in line with the insightful vision of the UAE's wise leadership and its keen interest to develop mosques and give them such a care that corresponds to their superior status. It is also in line with Awqaf's cabinet-approved strategic plan to take care of and maintain mosques with the aim to make them a serene environment conducive to worshipping," underlined Dr al Kaabi.
Dr al Kaabi praised the remarkable support to mosques by HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Sultan, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Emirates, highlighting their special interest in meeting the mosques needs as well as their directives to provide all that may help uphold their status and mission in the community.
"The main goals of the project are streamlining the periodic check-ups on the conditions of mosques, identifying their requirements in each area, facilitating communication with their staff at their locations and ensuring appropriate use of their potentials," Dr al Kaabi concluded.
