Islamic Affairs has recently launched an awareness campaign through Friday sermons to promote the role of Quranic memorisation centres, their curriculum and activities.
Memorisation of Quran courses take place in various Quranic centres and in mosques as sessions.
Speaking of the progress of studies at centres and sessions, the Islamic Affairs' Executive Director said, "there is a steady increase in the number of students [who signed up this year]. It rose by more than 4,000 compared to last year, pushing the total number of students up to more than 34,000, including Emiratis and residents. Buses were provided by Awqaf for free and there are no required study fees." 
The awareness campaign has included the distribution of leaflets in mosques and Quranic centres to introduce the Quranic centres, their role and activities. Also preachers from Awqaf will deliver speeches on Quran and memorisation centres and a Friday Khutba will be dedicated to this topic.
Dr al Mazrouei revealed that Awqaf would seek next year to organise memorisation sessions for people with special needs and appoint Quran instructors, who are skilled enough to deal with this segment of society.
There are currently 62 centres, 38 of which belong to Awqaf and 24 are community centres, while Quran sessions amount to 506 held in mosques all over the UAE.
