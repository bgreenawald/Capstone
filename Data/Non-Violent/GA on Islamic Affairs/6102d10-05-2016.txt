HH Sheikh Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan Humanitarian and Scientific Foundation (SBKF) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Awqaf.
Awqaf signed the MoU in its capacity as a federal entity responsible for implementing the UAE's vision related to Islamic affairs and Awqaf. This includes overseeing Quran memorisation centres and religious institutes as well as organising religious contests in the country.
Under the second article of the MoU, the areas of cooperation between both sides will include developing Sheikha Hessa bint Mohammad Al Nahyan Award for Holy Quran and exchanging expertise in organising cultural activities that highlight religious and national values. The article also encompasses joint consultation as regards to educational religious publications sponsored by the SBKF and exchange of academic studies and publications that can be used in printed materials, research and publishing, in addition to efforts in promoting innovation and creativity.
On this occasion, Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, stressed that the SBKF is one of the pioneering foundations thanks to its humanitarian and academic achievements serving the UAE, its citizens and residents.
"Sheikha Hessa bint Mohammad Al Nahyan Award for Holy Quran is one of SBKF's flagship accomplishments. By virtue of this MoU Awqaf and SBKF shall coordinate efforts in all matters that are conducive to the promotion of cultural activities of religious character. It shall also provide for the development of academic and religious personnel at the foundation. Awqaf will offer preachers and lecturers to animate religious activities organised by SBKF as well as approve its religious publications as per the standards in effect in UAE." Dr al Kaabi concluded.
