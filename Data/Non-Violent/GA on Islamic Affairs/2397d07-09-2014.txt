Islamic Affairs is set to dispatch Muftis along with the official Hajj delegation in a bid to address conflicting Fatwas. Pilgrims will therefore be able to call the UAE Official Fatwa Centre Muftis over the phone from the Holy Sites and ask questions pertinent to Hajj rituals.
HE Dr Muhammad Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf director general, said that the Official Fatwa Centre had held workshops for Muftis to discuss new Fatwas related to Haj. The aim was to qualify Muftis on how to deal with them with the goal of reaching a consensus amongst them and avoiding inconsistency.  
Muftis will also be available on the exit points to answer pilgrims' questions before departure. Muftis will deliver lessons and sermons at various delegation locations, said Dr al Kaabi, adding that the Fatwa Centre encourages pilgrims to think deeply about the meanings of Hajj, being a great act of worship. 
For this purpose he said that the Fatwa and research departments had printed several references on Hajj and Umra Fiqh and frequently asked Fatwas and booklets containing general tips and advice. They will be distributed to pilgrims before going to Hajj.
Dr al Kaabi explained that Muftis would also contact pilgrims after fulfilling Hajj and see how they had performed rituals and if they would need Hadiy (offer), a sacrifice, among others. 
On another note, the Official Fatwa Centre called on pilgrims to respect the tolerant teachings of Islam, which are based on moderate principles, and avoid taking the hard way in performing it. In this regard, the Centre invited people to follow the example of the Prophet Muhammad pbuh who was not asked about anything done before or after without him saying, "do it, and don't worry."
For his part, Dr al Kaabi advised pilgrims to contact the Hajj Delegation and drew their attention to the fact that pilgrimage is a sublime act of worship through which one can get closer to Allah. Thus it is crucial to observe the sanctity of the Holy Places, understand and experience the spiritual meanings Allah has incorporated in each and every Hajj ritual.
He further explained that the Fatwa Center in collaboration with the AD Quran Radio would air in the "Yastaftounaka" (they are asking you) program a time slot for answering questions related to Hajj.
