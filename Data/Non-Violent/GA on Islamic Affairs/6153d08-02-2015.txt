Arabs and international community must face those who have committed crimes in the name of Islam. The stances assumed by the UAE President, HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, have been marked from the very beginning by proactive determination, said HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman.
He added: "the UAE wise leadership has early and thoroughly understood the intentions of those rogues, who have falsely worn the cloak of religion. Our leaders decided to confront them, considering that the most dangerous enemy threatening mankind is the assault on humanity in the name of religion, said Dr al Kaabi.
"From this perspective, we call on everyone to be as firm as the UAE and other members of the international coalition against Daesh and similar groups. Sending a UAE fighter jets to Jordan is a sincere expression of how to side with brothers against the corruptors on earth. Indeed, the region would split if resolve was not the wise choice. This is what the UAE wise leadership expressed in words and deeds and this is the Arab and religious duty in such circumstances," Dr al Kaabi added.
Dr al Kaabi concluded by praying to Allah, the Almighty, to help HH the UAE President in his efforts towards maintaining the nation's glory and dignity and safeguarding rights.
