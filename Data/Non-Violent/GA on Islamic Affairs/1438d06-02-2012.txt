The General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments has compiled a documentary highlighting the main activities of the GAIAE since its foundation. The film, in Arabic and English, is one of the GAIAE's latest publications.
"Since HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of UAE, may Allah protect him, issued the law no. 34 of 2006 concerning the creation of the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments,  we have gone from strength to strength thanks to the unrelenting support by the prudent UAE leadership," HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, the GAIAE's Director General said.
He added that the film would expound upon the most important achievements by the GAIAE, ranging from the establishment of the Official Fatwa Centre, the standardisation  of the Friday prayer broadcasting, which is aired in turn from various emirates, the completion of the unified Adhan (call for prayer) project, the awareness campaign titled: "Our Mosques are the manifestation of  our civilisation" aiming at educating individuals on the importance of treating the houses of worship in a civilised manner to the installation of a network of display screens in mosques.
