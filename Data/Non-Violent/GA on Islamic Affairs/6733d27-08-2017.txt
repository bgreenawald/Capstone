The directives of the UAE astute leadership focus every year on the necessity of providing maximum care to the UAE pilgrims, making them happy and meeting their needs from their departure to the holy sites up to their return to the homeland, said Dr  Mohammad Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman and Head of UAE Official Hajj Mission.
The role of the UAE Official Hajj Mission is not limited to maintaining the safety, security and readiness of the UAE pilgrims' accommodation but to also providing them with round-the-clock comprehensive medical care in Mecca and Medina, he added, noting that emergency committees were assigned to deal with any circumstantial accidents and crises.
Dr Al Kaabi valued the great efforts exerted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under the leadership of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud as well as its publically acclaimed role in serving pilgrims and facilitating their rituals and its well-organised work aimed at maintaining the safety, security and stability of pilgrims.
All the services needed by pilgrims inside tents and other health and preaching services are provided by highly qualified and skilful administrators and workers, he said, noting that a state-of-the-art cooling system was installed in Arafat camp which included modern air conditioners at a rate of four units for each tent, each of which had a cooling capacity of 25 tons, bringing the total cooling capacity to 100 tons.
This quantum leap is taking place for the first time in the history of the most important ritual on Mount Arafat, Dr Al Kaabi pointed out, adding that a large number of ordinary fans and other water spray fans were installed in the corridors of the camp.
The Official Hajj Mission and its specialised committees also inspected the final preparations for receiving the UAE pilgrims in Arafat camp and were assured that all the facilities in the camps were working properly to provide a comfortable and reassuring atmosphere for the pilgrims before performing their rituals.
Meanwhile, a number of Saudi official authorities in charge of organising the Hajj season praised the UAE camps in the holy sites in Mecca. The vital installations, civil defence and water authority confirmed that the UAE camps came first and were the best in terms of care and provided services for the second successive year.
They pointed out that the camps provided seven-star services, thanks to their high-quality tents, which could adapt to all conditions and meet the requirements, their diverse spaces and their abundant services that focused on raising the operating capacity of air conditioners and providing the highest levels of safety and readiness to face all emergency cases and crises.
