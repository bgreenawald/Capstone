Awqaf's chairman, HE Dr Hamdan Musallam al Mazrouei, along with members of boards of directors, Awqaf's director general, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, branch directors and members of staff, gave their condolences to the bereaved family of Ahmad, the young Emirati who drowned while attempting to rescue an Asian family on RAK shores.
In his memory, Awqaf decided to name a new mosque in the Emirate after him, Dr al Mazrouei said, adding that some new mosques across the country will also bear names of members of the UAE Armed Forces who passed away while on duty as well as those who offered great services to this country.
For his part, Dr al Kaabi highlighted the tributes of the deceased, saying that he set a good example of courage in offering to rescue the sinking children, but sadly he could not fight back the elements and drowned as a result.
Dr al Kaabi added that such a noble act of bravery has earned him every respect and strongly brought into focus the fine characters of UAE people.
This initiative by Awqaf was welcomed by the deceased's family, friends and members of the community.
In the female mourning gathering, a preacher from Awqaf spoke of the value of patience and highlighted the reward Allah may bring to the bereaved parents in Heaven in return for their acceptance and endurance.
