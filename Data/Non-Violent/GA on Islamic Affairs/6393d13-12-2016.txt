During the visit, Sheikha Fatima was briefed on the most prominent achievements by Awqaf pertinent to the Quran memorisation centres and lessons at mosques.
Sheikha Fatima delivered a speech on the occasion in which she hailed the care and support given to Quran memorisation centres and lessons at mosque by HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE President, may Allah Protect him, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince by Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and HH Sheikh Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Ajman.

After that, Sheikha Fatima listened to recitations from the Quran by the female students of the centre and talked to them. She encouraged the students to be persistent on Quran recitation and memorisation, expressing her wishes of continuous success to the centre's management, tutors and students in their righteous endeavours and in learning the Quran sciences.
For her part, Muna al Ghassani, the director of Quran Memorisation Centres Department at Awqaf, valued the support and care given by HH the Ruler of Ajman to the houses of Allah and the Quran memorisation centres, as well as the continuous care and follow-up by his wife to teaching the Book of Allah and interest in instilling its values and instructions in the hearts of the younger generations, citing the role played by the holy Quran in bringing up generations that memorise it, know its sciences and adhere to its good manners.
Al Ghassani further underlined that, in framework of Awqaf's endeavour to encourage Emirati students to join Quran memorisation centres and learn Tajweed, it established the "Model memorisation centres", highlighting in this regard the initiative of Yusuf Sultan al Ajmani to construct Hajir Centre, which was built on a 22000 square-foot plot that was donated by HH the Ruler of Ajman.
