 In line with the directives of the astute UAE leadership in providing the best services to pilgrims, the Haj Umra Department within the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments held an induction meeting with various  Haj and Umra operators at its headquarters in Abu Dhabi.
The meeting was part of the GAIAE' efforts to develop the processes related to Haj and Umra services as per the strategic plan approved by the Cabinet. Operators were briefed on the latest proposed amendments to their profession, including the new "Haj Contract". This initiative  aimed at ensuring  the rights of both pilgrims and operators  and removing any confusion that may arise between contractors.
The meeting was chaired by HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, the GAIAE's Director General, who  said that consultations among different stakeholders representing the GAIAE, the Official Haj Delegation and operators would encourage all parties to deliver the best services to pilgrims while observing the highest standards and values.
"Communicating with Haj and Umra contractors is part of the early preparations for the next  Haj season and is a drive for involving operators in devising the most effective means and systems to the effect that the amendments to the contract between them and pilgrims become a legal reference that satisfies all parties," mentioned Dr Al Kaabi.
It is noteworthy that the GAIAE will soon launch a large-scale workshop aimed at all Haj operators to inform them of the new modifications. A similar workshop will be held for data entry clerks.
