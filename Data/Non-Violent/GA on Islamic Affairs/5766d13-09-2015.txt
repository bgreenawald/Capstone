HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman, said that the initiative of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, to establish an office in his Court to be in charge of the affairs of martyrs' families represents the UAE wise leadership's care for the families of the courageous martyrs who offered their pure lives to defend the nation.
"Our wise leadership has always launched such humanitarian initiatives, which show their love for the country and its citizens and indicate their support to the people at all times and in all situations," added Dr Al Kaabi.
The decision further highlights the wisdom of our leadership, which seeks to provide a dignified life for people and care for the families of the martyrs as they gave their pure life to defend justice, deter the oppressors, support the oppressed and rescue the Yemeni people, Dr al Kaabi said.
He noted that the martyrs showed the best example of sacrifice and acts of heroism on the war field, showing their loyalty and love for their religion, leaders and country.
"The leaders and people of the UAE have always worked together and moved steadily with a clear vision towards common goals, since the era of its late founder Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan," Dr Al Kaabi concluded.
