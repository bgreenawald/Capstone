The online Hajj registration portal that Awqaf provided for the Hajj season of 1438 AH as part of its online Pilgrims' happiness centre has shown that the average prices of Hajj packages ranged between AED 15000 and 35000. Factors affecting the prices included the campaign's programme, rating of accommodation, air flight class, methods of transportation in the holy sites, and the period of stay, which swayed between 8 to 10 days. 
Although the prices ranged between the above mentioned rates in general, yet the lowest price registered was AED 9,200 using land transportation, while the highest reached AED 75000. Moreover, the prices of a few number of the packages ranged between AED 60000 to 70000.
Hajj operators mentioned that the date for pilgrims' departure to the holy sites will start from August 26, 2017 and the return on September 5, 2017.
Data collected from the Hajj and Umrah operators across the UAE showed that the available seats, so far, varied between 40 to 150 seats per each campaign.
Worth mentioning, the Saudi Hajj authorities allocated a quota of 6228 pilgrims to the UAE for this year's Hajj season, an increase of 20 per cent compared with last year's quota.
On a related note, Hajj campaign operators stressed that the online Hajj registration system allowed them a good opportunity to know each campaign's quota of pilgrims, thus facilitating the completion of the relevant procedures. The campaigns across the UAE are due to be merged into 35 main campaigns, the aim being to reduce expenses.
