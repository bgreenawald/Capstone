The website of the General Authority for Islamic Affairs and Endowments earned full grade (100%) in an evaluation recently conducted by the General Information Authority (GIA). The evaluation of forty UAE Federal Government websites aimed at studying the websites' compliance with the World Wide Web Consortium and the guidelines developed by GIA experts. GAIAE website and seven other Federal Government websites were awarded the full grade. The average rate of compliance of the Federal Government websites was 73%.
The General Information Authority evaluated the websites on the basis of their compliance with specific requirements in the fields of domain name and hosting, site architecture and design, usability and accessibility, content and marketing.
The final evaluation, which will be conducted this year, aims to encourage the Federal Government entities to improve their compliance with the set standards. It also aims to unify and facilitate accessibility measures to all websites services. It is also hoped to consider federal website as a medium of interaction between officials and the people and to welcome users' opinions and contributions.
Dr.Mohamed AlKaabi, GAIAE director general, said that he was proud Â of the result and he applauded the efforts of GAIAE IT Department. He also hoped that such high standard will enable the UAE to be competitive in the UN E-government survey.
Regarding direct communication with the public, Dr.Alkaabi added that "We have the honor to be inspired by HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and HH Sheikh Mohamad bin Rashed Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister, Ruler of Dubai."
The General Information Authority prepared a list of evaluation checklist for all government entities to follow. It recently launched documents outlining guidelines for governments on web content, social media usage, eParticipation and open data.
