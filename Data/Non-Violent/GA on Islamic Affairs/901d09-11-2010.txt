General Authority for Islamic Affairs and Endowments (GAIAE) conducted in Abu Dhabi and Ajman two workshops for all UAE Hajj preachers. The purpose was to enhance the preachers' religious and cultural education as well as their preaching skills.
Mr.Mohamed Obeid AlMazrouei, Chairman of the UAE Official Hajj Mission, said "based on the strategy approved by the UAE cabinet, the first workshop, which took place at Mohamed bin Zayed Mosque in Abu Dhabi, focused on Hajj tenets, rituals and ethics. Preachers from Abu Dhabi, the Western regions, Baniyas and AlAin attended the workshop. They were urged to consider moderation and easiness in their fatawa (Islamic rulings) while abiding by the authentic Islamic scholars sayings and referring to GAIAE publications about Hajj and Fatawa."
Preachers were also advised to report any issues to the Hajj Mission. Fruitful discussions between preachers and workshop organizers resulted in agreeing on unified preaching and Hajj related fatawa. A similar workshop for preachers in the Northern Emirates was also conducted in Ajman.
