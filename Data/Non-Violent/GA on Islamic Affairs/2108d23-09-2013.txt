Awqaf has decided to introduce holy Quran memorising test for Imams on annual basis and award the winners valuable prizes, the director general, Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, said.
The decision came during the workshop of Awqaf branches' directors in Ajman, which was presided over by Dr al Kaabi and attended by the executive directors.
Awqaf had realised that Imams when they first sat for recruitment tests and interviews tended to be generally better memorisers and reciters than they were six months later, he mentioned.
The examinations will begin next January and 5,000 Imams across the country are expected to attend. A study will be made to determine the value of the prizes
Dr al Kaabi further said that the tests would assess whether Imams master the memorisation of the Quran and possess a good understanding of it.
Dr al Kaabi called on Imams and Khateebs to stay keen in memorising the Quran in order to increase the trust of recipients and mosque goers. He stressed that Awqaf would spare no effort to honour the distinguished Imams and that the wise leadership is always keen to encourage memorisers.
Also in the same workshop, some decisions were taken with regard to devising a long term plan for mosque affairs, including issues such as furniture, general maintenance and construction, as well as the project of Al Imam Al Jamea, an Imam who will be in charge of mosques near him in terms of religious and administrative matters.
Other decisions included increasing the number of qualified Khateebs, who can improvise Khutba at the level of each Emirate, motivating holders of higher academic degrees, among many technical and managerial issues at Awqaf headquarters and branches.
