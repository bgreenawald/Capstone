The Mosque Department has started updating its information management system, the GAIAE revealed. It is currently reviewing the following entries: names and locations of mosques, the date of their construction, their maintenance archives, assets and annexes, personnel's transfers in addition to an inventory of the mosques' monthly and annual needs.
Relatedly, the Awqaf has drafted a plan for maintaining mosques on the outer roads, assigning locations for new ones and reporting their needs. It will also fit mosques in some emirates with parking spaces for disabled people and corridors for wheelchair users.
On another note, the total number of registered students in the Holy Quran memorisation centres rose to about 22,000. This came as a result of the learning sessions that had targeted school students and the elderly and met the needs of various areas.
A further development in the Quranic learning activities was the establishment of model Quranic centres. These institutions aim at attracting more students and increasing the number of memorisers. There are now nine model centres in the UAE.
