In an interview with "Gulf News" newspaper, Dr.Mohammed AlKaabi, GAIAE director general, said that a total of 22.000 students are enrolled in the Qur'an Memorization Centers in the UAE, 7399 students of them enrolled in 2011. The large enrollment number is an indication of the success of the centers, Dr.AlKaabi added.  
He also noted that enrollment in these centers is open to the public. Students must be 6 to 18 years old. However, Waqf Centers (sponsored by religious endowments) welcome students of all ages.
Eligible teachers must have experience teaching the Holy Qur'an and theology. Mastering "Tajweed"(proper Quran recitation) is one of the requirements. If they are not hired by GAIAE, prior approval of their sponsors is needed before assuming their teaching positions. Teachers must also be of good conduct. They sit for computer-based as well as oral tests.
 Dr.AlKaabi added that nine model Qur'an Memorization centers have been established in 2011, and that GAIAE is eager to manage all Qur'an Memorization Centers to achieve the best performance.
Furthermore, GAIAE supervises private centers to ensure its adherence to GAIAE rules and regulations. Four main criteria are taken into consideration: teachers must have GAIAE work permits. GAIAE must receive  biannual reports on the center's activities and a ledger. GAAE must ensure that teachers do not use teaching materials other than the Qur'an. Meetings are also held with the directors of the private centers to improve work performance.
GAIAE supervises Waqf Qur'an Memorization Centers by making periodical visits, following up all workers' payroll disbursement, and receiving biannual and annual reports on their activities as well as ledgers.
It is worth mentioning that GAIAE Qur'an Memorization Department in collaboration with GAIAE IT Department is preparing a database for all teachers certified by GAIAE.
