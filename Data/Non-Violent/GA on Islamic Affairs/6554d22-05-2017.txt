"Such project will open doorways of benevolence in the UAE benevolent community through Waqf financing and donations from the Emirati people who are known for their acts of goodness and endeavours to support religious and cultural charity projects at both local and international levels," Dr al Kaabi concluded.
For his part, Faisal bin Haidar, executive director of printing and distribution sector at Dubai Media Incorporated and representative of Mohammed bin Rashid Holy Quran Printing Centre, said, "It gives us the pleasure to partner with the Awqaf, especially that the Mohammed bin Rashid Holy Quran Printing Centre has distinguished itself as the first of its kind worldwide while it is in its third year of inception. This has been achieved thanks to the latest printing systems and technologies it uses in printing the holy Quran under supervision of a religious committee that comprises elite scholars tasked with proofreading the printed editions, the aim being to preserve the sacredness of the holy Quran."
