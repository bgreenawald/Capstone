A delegation from the Al Anba Antonio Orthodox Coptic Cathedral Church in Abu Dhabi headed by Pastor Al Anba Bishoy visited the Islamic Affairs. Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman, welcomed the delegation and expressed his appreciation for the mutual visits.
Dr Al Kaabi praised the moderate and tolerant approach, which was adopted by the UAE society and was reinforced by the founding leader Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan and later by the UAE leadership under HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Dr Al Kaabi noted that such an approach was embodied in respecting the sacred sites and protecting the places of worship from all forms of extremism and extremists.
The law recently issued by the UAE President came to culminate the process of tolerance experienced by the UAE society and also to fortify it a well as to protect it against anything that might have a negative bearing on this sound path under any circumstance, said Dr Al Kaabi.
Meanwhile, the delegation praised the ideal environment that the UAE and its leadership provided in the UAE society, describing it as a civilised model for other countries to emulate.
"We confidently believe that the UAE society made steps ahead to ensure coexistence amongst people. Thanks to Awqaf solemn religious discourse, it  has established an environment that fosters such tolerance and enlightened civilised mode of thinking, which reflects the path of prophets and prophecies, particularly that of Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah who is the prophet of mercy for all mankind," the delegation said.
