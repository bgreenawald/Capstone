Mr.Hamad Mualla, GAIAE director for support services, said that GAIAE has updated all information and data displayed on electronic panels in all mosques. Mr.Mualla added that the purpose is to integrate such information with GAIAE annual preaching plan and the federal strategic plan (2011-2013) aimed at enhancing kinship relations and preserving the Arabic language.
There are 550 electronic display panels in UAE mosques, Qur'an memorization centers and some GAIAE offices. Mr.Mualla stated that these state-of-the art display screens replace flyers, posters and brochures, and improve the general appearance of the mosques. Intensive information and guidelines are being constantly displayed and updated during special religious occasions. The Official Ifta' (Islamic ruling) Center has added fatwa queries to the display screens to enhance Islamic legal knowledge. It is worth mentioning that the electronic panels display information in harmony with Friday sermons, preaching lessons, religious television and radio shows, newspaper articles and Manar Al-Islam, a religious and cultural magazine . Electronic display screens are programmed and controlled by GAIAE IT Department.
Mr.Mualla noted that the preaching plan for the year 2011 took into consideration GAIAE recommendations and implementation of the UAE vision (2011-2013) aimed at building a coherent society, keen to protect one's identity, in a country enjoying high quality educational and medical standards, a competitive economy, and a remarkable sustainable development .
