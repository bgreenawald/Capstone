In response to the directives of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, Awqaf started planting the Union Trees at the vicinity of mosques.
For this purpose, it took delivery of 15000 of the finest date palm seedlings, a donation by HH Sheikh Khalifa. They were produced by the date palm research and development unit at the UAE University in Al Ain. Some 1950 seedlings have now been planted nearby mosques in the capital city of Abu Dhabi.
Mr Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, the executive director of Islamic Affairs, together with Mr Rashid al Mazrouei, director of Awqaf branch in Abu Dhabi, in addition to many officials from Awqaf attended the planting of the Union Trees in front of the Sheikh Sultan Mosque in Al Bateen, the Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Mosque in Al Mushrif and the Aisha Abdul Rahman Mosque in Al Karama.
Another 135 seedlings would be planted in front of 29 mosques in the capital on the first day of this campaign.
Mr Mohammed al Mazrouei praised this generous donation, describing it as an initiative that would further highlight the wise leaderships' relentless support to the houses of Allah, whether to do with their construction, maintenance or decoration.
"Such a tree, fruitful as it is, will embellish the mosques' courts and add an extra touch of beauty and greenery. This is probably the reason why HH Sheikh Khalifa, the UAE President,  may Allah protect him, ordered on the occasion of the 41 anniversary of the Union to plant this blessed tree in front of mosques and other (government) buildings. Truly this action is a symbol of giving," he said.
Mr Mohammed al Mazrouei added that Awqaf branches all over the UAE were receiving their share of seedlings, which will be planted near all mosques in the upcoming days.
