 The General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments  has given the approval for the construction of 38 new mosques in the Emirate. The new mosques will be built in various places according to need.
Mr Ali Rashid Saeed Al Khanbouli, the Director of the GAIAE's branch in Ras Al Khaimah, said, "work has started on the new projects and some of them are expected to be completed this year.  Others are scheduled for next year." He added that the construction of these mosques was funded by benefactors, who were desirous to take part in charitable work through mosques.  
"The GAIAE  managed last year to deliver 26 mosques, 15 of which were renovated while  the remaining mosques-11 in total- were newly built in several  areas," said Mr Al Khanbouli.
Concerning maintenance work, he said that the GAIAE branch had coordinated the service of 32 mosques, 10 of them were carried out by the Ministry of Public Works and 22 by local inhabitants. He added that people there showed great interest in taking voluntary action to serve their areas and the various facilities.
On the occasion, he thanked all benefactors from all over the UAE and particularly from Ras Al Khaimah who volunteered to maintain mosques collectively or sponsor the construction of new ones. He explained that the GAIAE's role is to coordinate with the competent  departments  within Ras Al Khaimah government through the Municipality. The latter would allocate philanthropists with land plots for the constructions of mosques followed by an assessment of the space and the need  of the population across different areas.
