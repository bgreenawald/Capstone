Waqf projects are a continuing charity with long-lasting positive effect and generous outcome. Allah, the Most Exalted says, "Indeed, the men who practice charity and the women who practice charity and [they who] have loaned Allah a goodly loan - it will be multiplied for them, and they will have a noble reward." (Al Hadid:18).
