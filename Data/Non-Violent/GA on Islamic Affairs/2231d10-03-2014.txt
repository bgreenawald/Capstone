Islamic Affairs has affirmed that it has no connection with the distortion of a question on the rule of travelling to Mars, which has been circulated by media and attributed to the Authority.
Awqaf mentioned that there was a question put to its Fatwa Committee about the rule of humans travelling to Mars and never come back.
Accordingly, the Committee issued the following answer: "based on the texts and agreements of scholars, it is not permissible to travel to Mars and never to return if life is not possible there and the expectation of death is more than the possibility of life, due to this action exposing one to self-destruction."
