Awqaf has recently signed a contract with Al Turath Engineering Consultants (alturath) to build two mosques.
Part of Mafhas al Qatat programme, the two new mosques will be built in Umm Al Hosn and Al Manyour areas in Liwa, the Western Region at a cost of AED 4 mn. They will accommodate around 450 worshippers each.
The signing ceremony was held in Awqaf's headquarters in Abu Dhabi and signed by HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Qaabi, Awqaf's director general, and Mr Ahmed Mohammed Marzouq on behalf of alturath.
On this occasion, Dr al Kaabi lauded the great support from HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of UAE, may Allah protect him, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Rulers of the Emirates, Members of the Supreme Court, and HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.
 He also praised the positive response of donors to the Mafhas al Qatat, a programme launched by Awqaf for constructing mosques across the United Arab Emirates.
As per the contract, Alturath will draw various designs needed for construction and architectural works, as well as for sanitary, air-conditioning and electricity installations. The company will also prepare detailed studies for the projects and submit them to Awqaf for approval. It is expected to sign the contractual agreement next month. The construction will take a year as of the date of start of work.
It is worth-mentioning that Awqaf adopts architectural designs of high aesthetic value that match the civilisational progress of UAE and combine the local heritage and modernity. Awqaf is also keen to fit mosques with all means to help worshippers perform their prayers comfortably and in utmost serenity.
