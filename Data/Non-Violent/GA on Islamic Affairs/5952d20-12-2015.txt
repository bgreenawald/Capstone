Marking the success of this year's Hajj season, the Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan Charitable and Humanitarian Foundation will hold a celebration tomorrow to honour Awqaf and Hajj operators as well as the institutions that participated in the Zayed Hajj Programme.
To implement its programme, the Foundation has selected 29 operators to provide the necessary services for the UAE pilgrims amounted to around 1,500 pilgrims and their escorts in terms of accommodation, subsistence, transportation in the holy land and other services. These operators agreed to be integrated into six campaigns with the aim of promoting their services to pilgrims.
As a result of the extensive experience that the Foundation gained from implementing the programme over the past years, it attracted as many as 14 entities requesting the Foundation to sponsor their pilgrims during Hajj seasons.
