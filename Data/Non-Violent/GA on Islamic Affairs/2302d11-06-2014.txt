Awqaf has launched a series of workshops to help honing the oratory skills of Khateebs and refining their linguistic and literary flair. They are to be held at mosques all over the country with the first workshop taking place in Ras al Khaimah. Similar workshops will also be organised in various Emirates and will be attended by Khateebs nominated by Awqaf branches' directors.
This initiative translates Awqaf's awareness of focused training in upgrading linguistic skills of Khateebs, enhancing their psychological aptitude and developing their cognitive and academic abilities. Next round of workshops are due in October this year.
In a statement, Mr Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, the executive director for Islamic Affairs, said that Awqaf realises fully the level of excellence, which it seeks to achieve in training Imams and Khateebs. It also understands the current social environment of UAE in light of diversity, culture and the fact of being open to various trend of knowledge, stated al Mazrouei.
On this occasion, he praised the UAE wise leadership's support to Awqaf in undertaking its mission of promoting social awareness and progress according to the tolerant teachings of Islam that recognise the current realities and understand the future challenges.
As per the Awqaf's strategic plan, there will be two series of workshops annually. First Khateebs will be introduced to the requirements of a successful orator. Then they will be taught how to further develop their linguistic and literary capacities as well as upgrade performance abilities by improving psychological and cultural aptitude.
