Awqaf has achieved excellence in employing advanced and smart technologies in delivering its services. This resulted in the excellence achieved by its website, attracting more than 7,855,727 visitors during 2016, an estimated increase of more than 45 per cent compared to 2015, in which the website recorded around 5.4 million visits.
Such achievement kept in pace with the rapid increase in the usage of smart technology around the globe, and came in response to the initiative of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to support mGovernment and innovation, the ultimate goal being to achieve the "number one", a strategic objective of the UAE wise leadership.
According to statistics issued by Awqaf's IT department, Fatwa topped the list of preferred services, registering and increase of 55 per cent in the number of visits, followed by Friday Sermons and prayer timings. The statistics revealed that visitors of the website came from 217 countries around the world. 
Commenting on the achievement, Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, said, "this significant rise in the number of visitors to the website is due to many reasons, including credibility and public trust in the moderate religious discourse adhered to by the UAE, which is the state of tolerance, moderation and respect of peoples' cultures and civilisations, this being the essence of authenticity and modernity."
"Another factor lies in the regular update of the website's content in both Arabic and English and addition of new electronic services that ensured users quick and effective access, and allows positive interaction with the users through multiple channels of communication," Dr al Kaabi concluded.
