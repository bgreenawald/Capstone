Awqaf's director general, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi said that the inspection teams had checked pilgrims' accommodations for this year and confirmed they are of good quality. Reports also showed that they are close to the Holy Sites and most of them are in superior towers and residential areas. The special housing committee set by Awqaf flew to Saudi Arabia at the end of August.
Dr al Kaabi also mentioned that Haj and Umra department was coordinating with campaign operators as 4,982 pilgrims are leaving for the Holy Sites starting this week. This number respects the 20 per cent reduction in the quota as per the Saudi guidelines.
As for pricing issues, Dr al Kaabi explained that Awqaf did not intervene to determine the rates as they should remain a subject of supply and demand, adding that each operator is free to suggest the price according to the services it offers.
Meanwhile, Awqaf will closely manage pilgrims' affairs and examine their complaints, case by case and based on the contract they sign with their campaign operator, Dr al Kaabi said.
He revealed that Awqaf had allocated about 25 percent of quota to expatriates, a percentage deducted from that of Emiratis. Although expatriates have to secure a place with their own countries' quota, more than 1200 seats were offered to them following the instructions of the UAE leadership in recognition of the services they provide to this country, Dr al Kaabi said.
