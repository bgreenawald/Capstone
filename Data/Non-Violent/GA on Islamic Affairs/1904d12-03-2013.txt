Awqaf signed a contract with a national company to build a multipurpose hall in Ajman. Situated near Sheikh Zayed Mosque in Al Jurf area, the new facility, costing AED 1 mn, will serve the needs of the citizens in Ajman Emirate. It is set to be completed in 12 months as of the starting date of work.
In a statement following the signature of the construction contract, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's director general, highlighted the great support Awqaf is always receiving from HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, his Deputy HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Council, the Rulers of the Emirates, HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
Praising the kind follow-up of HH Sheikh Humaid bin Rashid Al Nuaimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Ajman, Dr al Kaabi added that the new convention centre will provide a suitable venue for the local community to organise their social events.
For his part, Mr Obeid Hamad al Zaabi, Ajman's branch director, stated that Awqaf was keen to have a design that is both compatible with the exterior of the adjacent Sheikh Zayed Mosque and up-to-date with urban development across the UAE. He added that Awqaf is committed to fitting Waqf projects with all necessary facilities and choosing the most beautiful architectural designs, ones that combine the contemporary and traditional styles.
