In a statement, Awqaf Chairman, HE Dr Matar al Kaabi, said that there were frenzied campaigns undertaken by suspicious and hit organisations. Most of these, he explained, had perhaps neither seen UAE, nor visited it before, or even known its location on the map.
They accused our country of restricting freedoms, non respect of human rights and right of expression, said Dr al Kaabi.
"Whereas the fact is that UAE, since its establishment by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace, has set the example to follow in preserving human rights," concluded Dr al Kaabi.
