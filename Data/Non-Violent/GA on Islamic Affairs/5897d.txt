Awqaf has approved the budget of the "Suqya Al Maa" project, which is being carried out in mosques through a specialist company that has been contracted to be the main supplier of drinking water for distribution on mosques in the form of healthy water bottles as a service to worshippers.
The "Suqya Al Maa" project is in line with Awqaf's vision and mission for its mosques to keep pace with the constructional and cultural development seen in the UAE and have all means that will help the different segments of worshippers to perform their prayers in a tranquil and comfortable manner, said Khaled Mohammed al Neyadi, Executive Director for Waqf Affairs.
This project complements the Awqaf's leading and distinctive projects that achieved a dazzling success, al Neyadi said, adding that Awqaf would supply mosques with drinking water at all times after contracting with a company to manufacture stands to be fixed on the rear wall of a mosque and contain more than 100 bottles of water. Awqaf contracted with a water company to supply mosques with around 32,000 cartons of water per month, he said.
Al Neyadi affirmed that the door is open for philanthropists to participate in and support this charitable project for the supply of drinking water through which they would be familiarized with the importance and grace of "Suqya Al Maa" as one of the best alms through which people get closer to Allah and solidarity and compassion prevail among the members of the society.
