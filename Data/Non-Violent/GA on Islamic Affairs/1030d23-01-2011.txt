GAIAE recently compiled an accurate list of awqaf (religious endowments) for Mosques all over the UAE. This survey, which was in line with GAIAE strategic planning approved by the Cabinet, aimed to increase awqaf investments.
H.E.Mr.Khaled Mohammad S.Al-Neyadi, GAIAE executive director  for Awaq affairs, stated that the  total number amounted to (985). Al Ain city ranked first with (342) wafq for Mosques. The estimated revenue from awqaf dedicated for Mosques has reached 25 Million Dirhams. It is to be noted that GAIAE has been promoting the tradition of waqf through campaigns, contests, workshops and seminars in view of its humanitarian benefits. Philanthropists have responded promptly following the saying of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh):"When a man dies, all his deeds come to an end except for three; an ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge or a righteous son who will pray for him."
