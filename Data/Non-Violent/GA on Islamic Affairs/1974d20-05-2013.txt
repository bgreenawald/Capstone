In line with Awqaf's strategic plan and for the promotion of its role in developing Khateebs' skills, the Friday Khutba committee held its regular meeting in Dubai. Presided over by HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's director general, the meeting looked into ways to put into effect the feedback from members of the public about sermons and preachers and examine mechanisms to further develop Khutbas whether in terms of subject, content and goals.
There are three categories of preachers: the outstanding speakers, who can improvise, and choose topics and content they deem appropriate. Second, partial improvisers, who can improvise the sermon prepared by the committee by, for example, selecting ideas from it and adapting its content. The last category includes preachers who only read out the sermon prepared by the committee without any improvisation.
For the last two categories, the committee compiled new string of sermons with modern thoughts that address the community issues realistically. Through them it looks forward to achieving awareness and guidance in light of the holy Quran and Prophetic tradition, based on principles of moderation. In drafting Khutbas, it was also keen to keep them short as the summer was approaching.
It is worth mentioning that the committee comprises specialists in Islamic studies and the Arabic language from all Emirates, and holds periodic meetings in Abu Dhabi and Dubai to assess the development of Khutba and Khateebs.
