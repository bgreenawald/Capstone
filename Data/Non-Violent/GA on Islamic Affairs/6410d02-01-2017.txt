As the world is getting ready to receive the New Year 2017, we see fresh and positive aspirations by individuals and communities worldwide. Leaders around the world declared their best and most effective plans for the best interest of their people, said Dr al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman.
"We, in the UAE, are grateful to Allah, the Almighty, for blessing us with a leadership that has nurtured goodness and giving as core values in our culture, filling our life with happiness and prosperity. All that have been promised by the UAE leadership had been fulfilled, thanks to the overwhelming sense of patriotism, the spirit of responsibility and the cohesion between our leadership and its loyal sons," added Dr al Kaabi.
Dr al Kaabi continued saying, "We are drawing a close to 2016, a year in which the UAE witnessed exceptional national and humanitarian achievements. Yet, we are getting ready for a New Year and a promising future, starting with optimistic approach by HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE President, may Allah protect him, hoping that the New Year will bear all the goodness to Emiratis and the whole world. Indeed, this is in line with our Master Muhammad pbuh's guidance. He urged for positive attitude towards all matter, saying 'Hope for the best and you will find it.'"
