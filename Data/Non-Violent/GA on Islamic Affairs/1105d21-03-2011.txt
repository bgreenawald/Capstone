The general Authority for Islamic Affairs and Endowments (GAIAE) has launched a website service that offers its users the chance to propose Friday sermon's topic, comment on previous Friday sermons, and provide recommendations and suggestions.
Web user friendly layout aims to connect and have more positive cooperation with the public. Users may access GAIAE website www.awqaf.gov.ae, then go directly to "help improve Friday sermon."
GAIAE offers diverse electronic services such as "suggestions and complaints" "the reliable guide (Islamic ruling), donation, waqf, and pilgrims registration (information).
GAIAE welcomes any public contribution that helps disseminate religious awareness. Friday sermon is an important tool to educate the public and can be enriched with new ideas and comments. Suggested topics are reviewed by GAIAE Friday sermon committee. The topic must be concise and precise. It requires two months for deliberation and editing the Friday sermon relating to the proposed topic.
It is to be noted that Friday sermon archives are available in both Arabic and English. Non-Muslims have reacted positively to the sermon English translation, the latest topic of which was "Parents' Good Treatment in Islam."
