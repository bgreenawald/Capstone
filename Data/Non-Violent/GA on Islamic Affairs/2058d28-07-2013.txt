Awqaf and ADCB Islamic Banking has signed an agreement whereby the latter supplies Awqaf with POS terminals as part of efforts to develop ways of promoting endowments resources. HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's director general, signed the contract on behalf of Awqaf, while on behalf of ADCB Islamic Bankinig Mr Mohammed Abdullah Jaber al Ali, head of the government banking at ADCB. The signing ceremony was attended also by Mr Khaled Mohammed Sayf al Neyadi, the executive director of Waqf affairs.  
Awqaf will take delivery of 57 wireless  POS devices that allow individuals to donate using debit and credit cards, ADCB announced. The new mode of payment was a result of concerted effort between Awqaf and ADCB Islamic Banking with the aim of helping customers donate more conveniently.
In a statement, Mr al Ali said, "we are glad to be part of this strategic partnership with Awqaf so we can support the culture of giving during the holy month of Ramadan. We also understand the needs of customers who prefer using cards than cash, something we took into consideration when designing this innovative mode of payment through POS terminals."
It is worthwhile mentioning that the wireless devices provided by ADCB integrate many functions and they are of light weight, allowing Awqaf to monitor donations easily. Moreover, they allow customers use debit and credit cards at donation points which before used to rely exclusively on cash and checks. Through the POS terminals, Awqaf will be able now to monitor the flow of donations made and get daily uniform report allowing quick and accurate audit of transactions without the need to carry cash.
