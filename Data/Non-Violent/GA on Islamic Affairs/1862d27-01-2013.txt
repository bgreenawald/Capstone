HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's director general, expressed his delight at the success of mosques' photo display organised by the government communication department across the Emirates. "Our Mosques in the UAE" featured many winning photos collected through a contest held earlier by Awqaf.
In a statement, Dr al Kaabi said it is necessary to bring into focus the efforts of our judicious leadership and generous UAE people in building and maintaining the houses of Allah. He also spoke of the unlimited support being offered to Awqaf by HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, his Deputy HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Council, the Rulers of the Emirates, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
He emphasised that Awqaf would continue to implement the leadership's directives so that mosques will always undertake their leading role in the community. The photo gallery showed exactly the measures taken by Awqaf in highlighting the civilisation status of mosques and providing the best of maintenance and architectural designs in their construction, Dr al Kaabi said. 
The photo contest organised by Awqaf had seen the participation of 10,000 photographs taken by more than 100 photographers, depicting various Islamic architectural styles of finest beauty.
It is also noteworthy that the display is part of the operational plan of the government communication department at Awqaf which has accompanied various local events organised by government institutions. This has made it accessible to a large number of visitors, who praised it together with the services of Awqaf to the public.
