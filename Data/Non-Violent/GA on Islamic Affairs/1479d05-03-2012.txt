The GAIAE Official Fatwa Centre issued a religious opinion permitting the payment of sums of money by typing offices' owners to their customers, who encourage other people to utilise their services. The new fatwa specifies, however, that the commission should be known and fixed for all.
The Fatwa Centre had received a religious query from an owner of a typing office asking whether it is permissible to give commission to customers who promote his business among potential clients. He says, "I have a typing office and request my customers to persuade others to buy my services in return for AED 500 for every 50 transactions and 1000 for every 100. Is this permissible? Should this money go to the beneficiary or the owner?
According to the Fatwa, there is nothing wrong with the  payment of such a commission which is interpreted as one remuneration for achieving a whole set of tasks. Many scholars held the same opinion, including Mostafa Al Sayooti Al Rhibani. In his book Matalib Ouli Al Nuha (Requests of the Mindful), he mentioned that it is permissible to pay a wage based on the fulfillment of an  agreed upon target.
