Awqaf in Al Ain will soon receive its new quarters located in the Administrative Centre, known as the Ministries Complex, which seats most government departments and entities.
The new offices are expected to be officially inaugurated shortly following the completion of the shift from the old building opposite Al Ain Hospital.
The three-storey building lies in a area of 1,500 square metres. It featured a mix of modern and Islamic design architectural patterns. It is adjacent to the Emirates Identity Authority and opposite to the Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority, Public Prosecution and Al Ain Courts Compound.
A number of additions and development projects took place in the Ministries Complex over the past few years.
