HH Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, inquired in a telephone call to the UAE official Hajj Delegation, about the well-being of UAE's pilgrims in the Holy places following the Mina stampede.
Reassured that the UAE pilgrims were not hurt by the sad incident, HH Sheikh Mohammed conveyed his greetings and best wishes to the pilgrims and urged the official Hajj mission to take all necessary measures to facilitate their performance of Hajj rituals comfortably.
Concluding a meeting with heads of the mission's sub-committees, Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman and head of the UAE Hajj Delegation, affirmed that the stampede site was far from UAE's pilgrims camps which were absolutely undamaged and made ready to receive the pilgrims returning from Mina in preparation for the following three Tashriq days.
The Saudi Civil Defense indicated that 4000 personnel were deployed to the stampede site alongside more than 200 emergency response units in order to disperse the groups of pilgrims and redirecting them to alternative routes. The injured were treated at four hospitals.
