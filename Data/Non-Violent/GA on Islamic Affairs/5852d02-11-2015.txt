Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, stressed that the UAE flag is a symbol of the nation's unity and the people's allegiance to the country's wise leaders who paved the way for its progress and prosperity.
Dr Al Kaabi said that the founding father Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may his soul rest in peace, and his founding brothers raised the flag decades ago and it is still hoisted high in our days by HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, as well as by his modernising brothers. "By so doing, they make us feel proud whenever we see the flag flying high on every Pole that belongs to our well-built country; whenever we see it printed on each Emirati airplane, tank and launcher that crumbles the hideouts of the losing oppressors; and whenever we see it decorating the chest of every brave soldier," Dr Al Kaabi added.  
Dr Al Kaabi continued saying, "the flag today, and on each day, has become an epitome of Arabs' high-mindedness. It glimmers with welfare, giving, relief and generosity at the time of international calamities and humanitarian initiatives. The UAE flag symbolises love and loyalty to the country's prudent leaders who respond to their people with close bonds and pride and who pledge to keep the flag high and protected by every soul in this land."
