His Eminence Grand Mufti of Egypt, Dr Shawqi Ibrahim Allam, praised the stances and support of the UAE people and leadership to the Egyptian people during the last years. In a statement upon arriving to Abu Dhabi International Airport yesterday, he emphasised that the relations of cooperation between the peoples and leaderships of the two countries were deeply rooted in history and strengthened by their common language and religion.
"The UAE people and leadership were the first amongst the Arab peoples and governments to support the Egyptians. Such generous support is a tradition for the UAE people and government as it is driven by the duty of religion and brotherhood. These factors united the two peoples and inspired such Emirati noble stances that are appreciated by all Egyptians," said Dr Allam.
Dr Allam praised the annual Programme of the Scholars guests of HH the UAE President, stressing that his invitation and participation in the program this season warmed his heart especially that the event is an opportunity to meet a distinguished group of scholars, most of whom were from Al Azhar. Having reviewed the topics in the program, he noted that they were not limited to the holy month only, but they addressed an array of contemporary issues.
HE Dr Allam arrived to Abu Dhabi yesterday afternoon to participate with the guest scholars in reviving the nights of the blessed month and to hold and participate in several symposiums. He was received at Abu Dhabi International Airport by Dr Hamdan bin Musallam Al Mazrouei, Awqaf's Chairman, Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, Executive Director for Islamic Affairs, and several other officials.
