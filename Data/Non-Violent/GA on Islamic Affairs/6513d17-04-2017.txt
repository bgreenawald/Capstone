HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, said the number of pilgrims who were registered in the online Hajj registration system reached 37224, of them 22291 males and 14933 female applicants. Hajj Registration for this year's season closed with the end of the previously announced deadline, Thursday, April 13, 2017. Applicants who wish to perform Hajj this year were satisfied with the registration process, having their transactions completed in just few minutes, he added.
Dr al Kaabi extended, on the occasion, heartfelt thanks and appreciation to all of departments and entities that received Hajj applications and registered the applicants, namely the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department in Dubai, the Sharjah Islamic Affairs, Tas'heel service centres, Tamm service centres in the Western Area, accredited Hajj campaigns operators and all of Awqaf's branches across the UAE. 
"The online registration has created a competition amongst Hajj operators in offering their best services to pilgrims. As a result, Hajj packages saw a drop in prices, starting from AED 12500 per pilgrim up to 25500 or more based on the type of services offered," added Dr al Kaabi.
Dr al Kaabi further highlighted that within the coming few days, Awqaf will start sorting out the registered names and inform applicants accordingly, noting Awqaf adopted that this year a selection mechanism in which 80 per cent of approved pilgrims will be from first-time applicants and the remaining 20 per cent will be allocated to Mahrams and those who accompany ill people, the elderly and people with special needs.
