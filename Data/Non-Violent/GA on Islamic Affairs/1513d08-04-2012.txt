The GAIAE's branch of Umm Al Quwain opened two new mosques in two areas of the Emirate. Costing about AED 1,6 mn both mosques-each with a capacity of about 200 worshippers- were financed by beneficiaries. They feature a modern design, which reflects a deep Islamic architectural heritage and the distinctive urban development of the UAE.
Several more mosques are under way in addition to periodic maintenance of some existing ones, Mr Mohammed Ibrahim Hamid, the Umm Al Quwain's branch director, said.  Mr Hamid hailed the contributions made by donors and those destined to serve the houses of Allah. He said that there had been close coordination between the GAIAE's branch in Umm Al Quwain and other competent departments in the Emirate in matters relative to the provision and demarcation of land plots as well as the issuance of necessary construction licences and certificates.
"There is a future plan that corresponds to the urban development in Umm Al Quwain for the construction of new mosques in the new residential districts as well as in the commercial and industrial areas of dense population. We are very keen to meet the demands of all areas with the aim of assisting all members of the community to perform  their daily prayers in the mosque," said Mr Hamid.
The Obeid Belhwis Mosque in the Al Salma area was built at a cost of AED 850,000 and the Ghanem Sultan Mosque in the Idhaa area at AED 750,000. Each mosque will cater to  about 200 worshippers. They are comprised of female prayer rooms, all necessary facilities, including ablution areas and restrooms in addition to the Imam and the Muezzin's houses. They have also been fitted with water and electricity, furnished and connected to the unified Adhan system.
