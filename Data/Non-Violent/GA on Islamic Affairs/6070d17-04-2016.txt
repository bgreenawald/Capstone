Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, revealed the smart Waqf Campaign plan for the second quarter of 2016. Through this campaign, Awqaf seeks to educate the public about Waqf and its channels and introduce innovative solutions to promote it amongst people, Dr al Kaabi said. It is also aimed at collecting donations, producing digital content that can be used in many messages and creating a model, which can attract local and global interest, he explained.
"Awqaf further intends to produce a future plan for the sustainability of the campaign, and the consolidation of the entity's image and vision in the mind of the public through the announcements that accompany the smart Campaign, in addition to developing a special interactive version for children to be posted online," Dr al Kaabi said.
Dr al Kaabi pointed out that within the smart Waqf campaign, there is a "Smart Campaign Fund" where the campaign fund interacts with the donors through special text messages that display video clips sorted by donations and the endowments they are allocated for.
With regard to the most important expected Waqf projects due for completion during the current year, Dr Kaabi said, "we have six Waqf projects which are expected to be finished during this year, including the land of Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed in Abu Dhabi, Anneyadat Villa, Al Jimi villa and Hamad al Ameri villa in Al Ain. Projects include as well the renovation of two buildings in Sharjah and a building in the Western Region at an estimated cost of AED 50 million. The expected proceeds are estimated to reach AED 4 million annually. There are also three projects we expect to be accomplished during the current year, including the Sheikh Zayed Waqf building in Khalidiya in Abu Dhabi, Ghanem al Mazrouei villa in Al Ain, and Sharjah industrial building."
