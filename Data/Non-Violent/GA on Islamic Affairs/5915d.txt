HH UAE President's guest scholars gave lectures yesterday, Ramadan 10th, on two significant themes; the first about the fasting person's supplication not being rejected and the second about how to build the culture of tolerance in our children.
In the first theme, the scholars talked about supplication and explained its benefits and how people need the support of their Creator, particularly in the holy month of Ramadan, in which the Messenger of Allah pbuh was quoted as saying that a fasting person's supplication will not be rejected at the time of "Suhoor", after prayers, at "Iftar" and at every hour of the fasting period. This is because Allah Almighty promised fasting people to answer their supplications as seen in Surat Al Baqarah "when My worshipers ask you about Me, I am near. I answer the supplication of the suppliant when he calls to Me; therefore, let them respond to Me and let them believe in Me, in order that they will be righteous", they added.
Answering supplications is part of Allah's grace and generosity to those with good deeds, the scholars said, adding that a fasting person practices a hidden act of worship which only Allah Almighty knows about. A fasting person gives up food, drink and all pleasures of the world in response to the divine order as seen in His saying, "believers, fasting is decreed for you", they said.
According to the Prophetic tradition, Allah Almighty boasts about fasting people to His Angels, as he says: "a man gives up his food and his drink for My sake. O Angels, witness I have forgiven him", they added.
The scholars explained the manners of making supplications, the most important of which were thinking well of Allah Almighty and praying to Allah Almighty while being fully confident of His answer.
The scholars also talked in their lectures about how to build the culture of tolerance in our children.
