Awqaf Chairman, HH Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi said that the committee in charge of receiving complaints from Hajj pilgrims had studied them and was now receiving replies from Haj operators. He pointed out that campaigns which would be found breaching regulations would be removed from the accredited list.
To avoid recurrence any irregularities Dr al Kaabi suggested cooperating with Saudi authorities to monitor Haj permits. In this regard, he suggested a mechanism for rejecting UAE citizen pilgrims registered with Haj operators based outside the country.
Dr al Kaabi added that UAE Hujjaj's Office is considering reducing costs while maintaining good quality services. It is noticed, for example, that flight tickets are more expensive than in neighbouring countries. On another note, he announced that Awqaf is thinking of establishing a consultative body composed of approved Hajj operators, which will be authorised to help Awqaf in ways to reduce Hajj related costs.
