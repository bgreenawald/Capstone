In response to the Cabinet resolution for making 2013 a year for boosting the Emiratisation process, Awqaf conducted a series of interviews leading to the hiring of 34 Emirati candidates, men and women.
Trained in Islamic studies and languages as well as business administration and finance, they represented the first batch of Emiratis to join Awqaf this year. They were appointed in posts and grades according to their academic qualifications.
Most of the new Emirati staff are university graduates with diploma, bachelor and master degrees. They have been assigned to work in preaching, research, the holy Quran memorisation centres and administration and finance.
HE Dr Hamdan Musallam al Mazrouei, Awqaf's chairman, received the newly recruited staff in the presence of Awqaf's director general and executive directors. In a statement, he urged them to work in the specialisations suitable for their profile in various branches of Awqaf. He also explained the role of these disciplines and how they can serve the nation and the community.
Indeed the nation needs to employ the powers of its citizens to propel the progress, prosperity and comprehensive development processes, Dr al Mazrouei said, stressing that this is a top priority.
