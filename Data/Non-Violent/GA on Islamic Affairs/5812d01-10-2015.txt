Pilgrims have completed Ramiye Al-Jamarat, one of the Hajj rituals at Mina. They will then head to the Grand Mosque to perform the Farewell Tawaf before departing Mecca.
Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman and Director of the UAE Hujjaj Affairs Office (HAO), expressed his gratitude to the UAE wise leadership for their unrelenting support to the UAE pilgrims, and their diligent supervision on pilgrims' affairs. He said the UAE pilgrims are the focus of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and deputy supreme commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and Their Highnesses, Rulers of the Emirates. They have endeavoured to address any challenges that the UAE pilgrims, citizens and residents, might face in performing the Hajj rituals, added Dr Al Kaabi.
Dr Al Kaabi praised the generous support provided by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and prayed to the Almighty to reward him for his efforts in ensuring all means of comfort to UAE's pilgrims.
He explained that all UAE pilgrims were fine, and that there were no problems, serious diseases or injuries, noting that they had already completed their Hajj performance and were waiting to perform the Farewell Tawaf.
Dr Abdul Karim Al Zarouni, head of the medical committee, said that all pilgrims would be subject to ordinary preventive measures for 21 days after their return to the UAE to ensure they are completely clear of any injuries or diseases. The medical committee has not received any cases with serious diseases during this year, save some cases with the flu, and ordinary injuries.
