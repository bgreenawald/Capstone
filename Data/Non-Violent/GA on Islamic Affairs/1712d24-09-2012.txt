The GAIAE' director general, HE Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, discussed with HE Harib al Hameli, the vice president of operations at Abu Dhabi Airports Company (ADAC), and the delegation accompanying him ways to ease the travel procedures for pilgrims through Abu Dhabi International Airport.
Dr al Kaabi first highlighted the special interest of the prudent UAE leaders in all of the pilgrims' issues and concerns and praised their unlimited support for the official Haj delegation and the best services they provide.
Dr al Kaabi also spoke of the role of the Abu Dhabi international Airport's management in facilitating Haj travel processes.
Both sides discussed a mechanism for distributing Haj booklets prepared by the Awqaf and making sure they reach all travelling pilgrims in addition to defining the appropriate places in the airport halls where preachers should be available. The latter are assigned by the GAIAE to answer queries from pilgrims.
For his part, Mr al Hameli thanked the GAIAE for its considerable efforts in managing Haj affairs and keen interest to providing all means of comfort for pilgrims throughout their journey. He said that the ADAC is fully ready to serve them and ease travel procedures for them whether in departure or arrival through Abu Dhabi airport.
At the end of the meeting, Dr al Kaabi presented the ADAC delegation with the Awqaf's shield and certificates of appreciation.
