The UAE preparatory Hajj mission left from Abu Dhabi International Airport to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in preparation for receiving the UAE Hajj campaigns. The mission will also receive pilgrims' camps in Mina, Arafat and Musdalifa and complete all the necessary preparations, contracts processing and all other arrangements agreed upon with the competent authorities in Saudi Arabia.
The preparatory mission includes all the important committees. Meanwhile, the official Hajj mission will leave to Saudi Arabia within a week accompanied with the medical and media committees as well as the mission's other sub-committees.
In this connection, Dr Mohammad Mattar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman and head of the UAE Hajj mission, gave the members of the preparatory mission all instructions necessary for commencing their official duties ahead of the arrival of the UAE pilgrims to the holy sites. The aim is to provide pilgrims with the best services and touch their hearts with happiness.
On the occasion, Dr al Kaabi prayed to Allah, the Almighty, to make it easy for the pilgrims to perform their Hajj rites in line with Islam's teachings and aspirations of the UAE wise leadership. He implored to Allah to also protect the pilgrims throughout their Hajj journey.
