In the framework of the brotherly relationship between the wise leaderships and people of the UAE and Egypt, Awqaf and al Azhar signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to establish a branch for al Azhar University in the UAE, to be the first of its kind worldwide.
The MoU was signed from al Azhar side by its Grand Imam, His Eminence Dr Ahmed Mohammed al Tayeb, and from Awqaf side by its Chairman, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi.
On this occasion, Dr Ahmed Al Tayeb hailed the ever-remembered stances by HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, and his prudent leadership towards Egypt and the Egyptians, noting that this came in line with the approach of late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace.
"The cooperation between al Azhar and Awqaf is a continuing process in terms of organising activities, initiatives and conferences," al Tayeb said, urging for crowning such efforts with the opening of the first branch of al Azhar outside Egypt.
For his part, Dr al Kaabi stressed that Al Azhar's methodology of moderate and scholarly thinking coupled with its practices, Fatwas, research and studies, preachers, Khateebs and curriculums are in line with Awqaf's aspirations in keeping abreast with all developments in the contemporary time and producing an Islamic culture.
"Indeed, the world nowadays needs the values ​​of Islam to be highlighted amidst accelerating variables that can be governed and guided only by a deep rooted authoritative reference such as al Azhar and similar religious entities. Therefore, more coordination is needed amongst such institutions. Undoubtedly, al Azhar University will attract male and female students in the UAE and will be given a high status amongst the UAE academic and research institutions as well," Dr al Kaabi concluded.
