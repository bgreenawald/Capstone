Awqaf Chairman, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, stated that the publication of the list of designated terrorist organisations groups translates the wise leadership's efforts spurred by HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him. This endeavour is specially aimed at addressing terrorism and laying the foundation for peace and security.
Since its establishment the UAE had strived to ensure stability to its citizens through criminalisation of all aspects of terrorism, Dr al Kaabi said, adding that this reflects its interest in strengthening international efforts in combating terrorism with the ultimate goal of ensuring continuing stability and security for UAE citizens and residents.
On another note, Dr al Kaabi said that terrorism distorts the true and beautiful image of Islam in the eyes of coming generations. That is why it is mainly a duty of Arab and Muslim countries to expose the goals and practices of such organisations. Also they need to highlight the true nature of Islam, which is sent as a mercy to the Worlds, especially at this time when terrorism is threatening many countries. This requires imposing strict sanctions to counter it.
Thus, the issuance of this list came to serve the interests of citizens and shall enhance safety and stability as well as confirm the unwavering will of the government against anyone who attempts to disrupt the country's security.
Further, Dr al Kaabi said that the UAE wise leadership is always caring about the welfare of citizens by meeting their requirements and protecting their lives and integrity.
