The exams for licensing with sound chain of authorities for Quran memorisers and students of Quran memorisation centres across the country begins on June 1 and conclude by June 12, 2017.
Commenting on the topic, Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, said, "Licensing with chain of authorities that are connected to the Messenger of Allah pbuh is one of the UAE's unique and unprecedented initiatives at the level of the Islamic world. It was launched by Awqaf at the beginning of the current year and was announced through the media outlets."
"The first course with participation of 99 male and female memorisers which lasted for four months has concluded, and now is the time for conducting the exams in order to grant the successful memorisers licenses with the chain of authorities in Hafs recitation," Dr al Kaabi explained.
Dr al Kaabi concluded by stressing that Awqaf will continue such courses to include all those who are interested in attaining such elite honour in Quran sciences.
