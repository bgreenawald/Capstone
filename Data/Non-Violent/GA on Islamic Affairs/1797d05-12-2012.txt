In the implementation of the initiative of the "Union Tree" launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, the director of Awqaf' s branch in the Western Region, Mr Sultan al Mazrouei planted a tree in the courtyard there.
Members of staff, male and female, joined him in planting the tree, an action that has strong meanings symbolising the solid foundation of the Union.  The Union Tree carries a clear message that the values of the Union should be promoted amongst citizens, Mr al Mazrouei said, adding that the plantation of the Tree came to bring into focus the principles of unity and the achievements it has brought since the foundation of the UAE.
 Truly, the Union and its enhancement had been the focus of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace, and that of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness The Rulers of the Emirates, HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Ruler's representative in the Western Region.
