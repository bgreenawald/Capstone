In the implementation of the directives of the astute UAE leadership  and in line with the strategic plan of the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments as approved by the Cabinet, HE Dr  Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, the GAIAE's Director General, announced that the GAIAE had completed  the procurement of the finest acrylic carpets to furnish all the mosques throughout the UAE that need carpeting this year.
On this occasion, Dr Al Kaabi pointed out that caretaking of the mosques receives special interest from HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of  the UAE, may Allah protect him, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice President, the UAE Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, their brothers Their Highness the Rulers of the Emirates and General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces
By fitting mosques with the best of carpets to better their appearance  so as to meet the  expectations of the attendees, the GAIAE complies with the orders of Allah, The Most High: "take your adornment at every masjid," (Al Aaraf:31), said Dr Al Kaabi, adding that worshippers entering the mosque should notice the beauty and cleanliness of the place so as to set an example for them to follow when it concerns their own personal adornment.
It is worth mentioning that the GAIAE carpeted  500 mosques last year, including those assigned to host Friday prayers (Jumaa) and those for five prayers only (Jamaa).
