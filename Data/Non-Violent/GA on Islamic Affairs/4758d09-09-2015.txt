The Emirates Red Crescent Authority (ERC) has received more donations for the "Yemen: We Care" campaign, which was launched under the directives of HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the UAE, and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and under the stewardship of HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Ruler's Representative in the Western Region, Chairman of the ERC.
The Islamic Affairs donated AED 1 million in support of the campaign. Dr Mohammed Atiq Al Falahi, ERC Secretary General, received at ERC headoffice a cheque in the said amount from HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman.
Dr Al Kaabi affirmed that the Awqaf's contribution came in response to the directives of the UAE's wise leadership, which placed the Yemenis' conditions on top of its priorities, and in solidarity with the campaign aimed at rallying support for the victims of the crisis in Yemen.
"The donation is also in line with Awqaf's commitment to its social responsibility and keenness to demonstrate its solidarity towards the local and external humanitarian issues and support social and humanitarian work and development efforts," Dr Al Kaabi said, stressing that Awqaf would spare no effort to support ERC's activities both inside and outside the UAE.
Meanwhile, Dr Al Falahi expressed ERC's appreciation of Awqaf's initiatives that complement ERC's humanitarian efforts, emphasising that Awqaf had always been a key partner and a strong supporter of its humanitarian programmes.
