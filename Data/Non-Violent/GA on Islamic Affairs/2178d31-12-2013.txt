Awqaf's Imams and preachers will soon sit for a test to assess their Quran memorisation abilities. This came following a decision taken during an earlier meeting of Awqaf branches' directors.
Awqaf realised that Imams when they were first recruited tended to be better memorisers than they became later. That is why Awqaf decided to conduct an annual memorisation test for Imams and preachers, said HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's director general, adding that in the mean time they can prepare for the exam.
In an interview with Al Ittihad newspaper, Dr al Kaabi explained that the test would be delivered electronically in a move to ensure transparency. The testing committee members were trained on using the software and other exam procedures.
"Imams and Khateebs will answer the questions with no human intervention. The examinee needs first to provide personal information to prompt more questions. The first one is do you memorise Quran? If the answer is positive, the exminee is asked to press the yes button. The next question asks him to complete Ayas. Meanwhile, the committee will evaluate his answer. Thus he proceeds with the rest of questions," said Dr al Kaabi.
He added that Awqaf branches can set exam schedule of their own and undertake it locally without referring to the headquarters in Abu Dhabi. Imams should be notified about the date and time of their exams while only five persons can be tested per day.
Exams will start as of early January, 2014, and will involve 5000 Imams across UAE. Awqaf pledged to offer valuable prizes to the most outstanding memorisers, he said.
On this occasion, Dr al Kaabi reiterated Awqaf's sincere gratitude to the UAE wise leadership for their unyielding support to memorisers of the holy Quran.
