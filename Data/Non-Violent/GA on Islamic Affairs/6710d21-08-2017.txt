HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman and Head of the UAE Official Hajj Mission, lauded the great care given to the UAE pilgrims by the UAE wise leadership. He further highlighted the kind support by the astute leadership and their close follow up to pilgrims' affairs, the aim being to touch their hearts with happiness and provide them with all means of comfort that are conducive to helping them to perform their Hajj rituals in an easy and facilitated manner.
Dr al Kaabi extended, on the occasion, his thanks and appreciation to the UAE Armed Forces, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Health and Food Control Authority for their concerted efforts in serving the UAE pilgrims.
The head of the UAE Hajj mission also underlined the praiseworthy efforts of Hajj campaign operators and their keen interest, year after year, to compete in delivering the best services to UAE pilgrims.
On another level, Dr al Kaabi highly valued the role played by the government of the Guardian of the Two Holy Mosques as well as the Saudi people in serving the pilgrims round the clock all over the holy places in each Hajj and Umrah season.
"The Saudi government strive to elevate the level of services offered during the performance of such a great act of worship. This can be seen in the continuous expansion carried out in all the holy places, in addition to the massive expansions in Al Masjid Al Haram throughout the past years in order to accommodate the increasing numbers of pilgrims who come to the holy sites to perform their Hajj rites in utmost tranquillity, security and safety.
On a related note, Dr al Kaabi said that the UAE's 6228 pilgrims are set to leave to the holy places between 17 and 28 August 2017, adding that the UAE official Hajj mission is ready to receive them there in collaboration with Hajj campaign operators, ensuring to offer them the best of services and guarantee their safety and comfort at all times.
Dr al Kaabi concluded by praising the initiatives launched by the UAE airports targeting pilgrims and the means of comfort and facilitation as well as elite services they offer to them, making all stakeholders partners in serving the best interest of Hujjaj.
