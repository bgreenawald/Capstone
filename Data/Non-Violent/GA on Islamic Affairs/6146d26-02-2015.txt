In implementation of its strategic plan to develop Waqf resources according to modern transactions, Awqaf signed with  Burjeel L.L.C. and Medeor 24X7 Hospitals two long-term lease contracts fetching an annual rental of over AED 10.5 mn for the city centre and Asharej residential compounds in Al Ain City.
The two contracts were signed on behalf of Awqaf  by HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Chairman of Awqaf, and for the two hospitals by their representative Dr Shamsheer Vayalil Parambath.
Following the signing ceremony, Dr al Kaabi said, "the continuous support to Waqf projects by HH Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Supreme Deputy Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Emirates, has allowed Awqaf to achieve remarkably well in terms of  Waqf development and  investment spanning many areas: social, educational, health and humanitarian services."
"The signing of these two contracts is an addition to Al Ain city. By virtue of the two contracts, Awqaf will contribute to the delivery of the best health services to Al Ain city and surrounding areas, thus achieving its civic and humanitarian mission," Dr al Kaabi added.
To ensure a modern Waqf foundation in UAE of strength, there needs continuous awareness of this sector amongst the community, Dr al Kaabi said, adding that this can be possible by investing largely in strategic investment areas.
