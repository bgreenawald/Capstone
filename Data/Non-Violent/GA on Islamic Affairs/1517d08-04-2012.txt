People with special needs will have parking lots designated for them in front of the mosques in Umm Al Quwain as the GAIAE's branch started assigning places for this purpose and crossing areas reserved for wheelchair users. Some of the mosques had already been equipped with such a facility. The move is aimed to ease the movement of this segment of society when they get on or off their vehicles.
Mr Mohammed Ibrahim Hamid, the GAIAE's branch director, said that the Awqaf had devoted great interest in disabled people and understood their circumstances and basic needs. All of the Emirate's mosques totalling 155 will be endowed with these facilities, which will be conveniently adjacent to the mosque.
Mr Hamid explained that in the past, many people used to have difficulties in finding parking lots for their vehicles, especially on Fridays,. He added that Umm Al Quwain's branch would provide parking places in the rest of mosques in different places across the Emirate, mentioning that there is continuous collaboration amongst government departments in order to alleviate the burden on disabled people  and offer them equal services.
Mr Hamid further explained that the said parking lots will be marked by different colours and signboards. On the occasion he warned other motorists not to use them; otherwise, they will be fined.
