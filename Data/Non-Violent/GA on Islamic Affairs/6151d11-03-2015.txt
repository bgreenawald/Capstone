Awqaf is to organise the first workshop for the Hajj and Umrah operators at Al Jawhara Ballroom of Hilton Sharjah Hotel on March 11.
Awqaf will discuss with the operators the implementation of the initiative for early electronic registration of pilgrims, covering instructions and procedures. Other topics on the agenda include, the instructions related to the 1436 AH Hajj season, the schedule for administrative procedures, the requirements of the Saudi Ministry of Hajj e-route system and a number of other topics with respect to regulating the activities of this year's Hajj season.
The meeting came  as part of Awqaf's strategic plan and in line with its policy and keen interest to improve Hajj and Umrah services. From this perspective, Awqaf stresses the need for campaign operators and contractors to show extreme diligence in this connection.
