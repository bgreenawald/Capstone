 The General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments released the fourth print of the Holy Quran for 1433 Hijri (2012). The 100,000 copies produced meet  the norms agreed upon by  the Quran script scholars and memorisers in accordance with Hafs an Assim riwaya (recitation).
HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, the GAIAE's Director General, said this move is part of the GAIAE's continuing efforts to provide mosques with copies of the Holy Quran and withdraw the damaged ones. About 5000 mosques will benefit from it, mentioning that "the famous calligrapher Uthman Taha had the privilege of writing the newly printed copies in the Uthmani script, the agreed upon style of writing."
The  third page reads :"Waqf Lillahi Taala" (endowment for the sake of Allah). The Quran is printed in medium and large font and is convenient for the elderly or those with impaired vision. The copy is printed using high quality paper, colours  and fine motifs, which also reflect such beautiful ornaments that have always characterised the Islamic arts and civilisation.
