As part of its awareness activities, the government communication department at Awqaf organised in coordination with Sheikh Khalifa Medical City (SKMC) a lecture on ways to avoid dependency on medicine as a treatment.
The lecture was delivered by Dr Abdullah al Darwish, a consultant psychiatric and medical director at SKMC, and was attended by a host of employees.  Dr al Darwish first lauded the interest of Awqaf in hosting these awareness activities, saying they can help benefit staff's health and output.
Then he highlighted the misuse of drugs, dependency on their treatment and the resulting consequences. He stressed the importance of creating a synergy between body and soul and developing a positive attitude to handle sickness or any other health conditions that may affect the person.
In fact, this represents the great part of the cure, he said, adding that people need to avoid as much as they can sources of tension and anxiety. The latter is often the cause of varying psychological disorders, which may develop into a serious condition requiring some psychotherapy.
For his part, Mr Hamad Yusuf Muala, the executive director for support services at Awqaf, said that this lecture was part of the operational plan set by the government communication department, which seeks to meet Awqaf's social responsibility by coordinating with various institutions as per the directives of the UAE wise leadership.
