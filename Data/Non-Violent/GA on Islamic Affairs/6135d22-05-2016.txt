Preparing for the holy month of Ramadan, and in implementation of the initiative of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE President, may Allah protect him, to make 2016 a year for reading; Awqaf has compiled a kit of 12 booklets related to the holy month.
The collection covers Fatwas on fasting, the value of reading Quran in Ramadan, rulings of Zakat on wealth and that of Al-Fitr, Dhikr for Ramadan, morning and evening Dhikr, The Humanitarian Day, Ramadan 19, in addition to merits of late Sheikh Zayed.
On this occasion, HE Dr Mohammad Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, said that Awqaf was currently printing 360,000 copies from these booklets, adding that they were made easy so to suit readers from all age groups. These cover several aspects of worships performed in Ramadan as well as the social relationships during this holy month in particular, being the month in which Allah blessed mankind when the first revelation of the holy Quran came down to the Prophet pbuh in the cave of Hiraa, he explained.
"The first thing the Prophet was asked to do through Gibril was to 'recite'. Indeed, in this there was a Quranic sign of the great human transformation that the Quran recitation would bring to mankind," Dr al Kaabi added.
"It is with reading that nations have made advancements. Through reading cultures come closer, civilisations advance and knowledge-based economies prosper in the best interests of mankind," Dr al Kaabi concluded.
Awqaf would like to seize this opportunity to urge all members of the community to read and promote the virtues of reciting the Quran in mosques, social gatherings and at home.
