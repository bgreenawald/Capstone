The Islamic Affairs completed the last phase in implementing the Unified Adhan project in mosques of Ghayathi and surroundings, Ruwais, Jabal Al Dhanna, Bidaa Al Mutawa, Umm Al Ashtan, Umm Al Hosn, Al Hamra and Sir Bani Yas Island.
The director of Islamic affairs, Mr Mohammed Obeid Al Mazrouei, said that the completion of the project in the Western Region would highlight the strategic plan led by Awqaf and aimed for upgrading services offered to the community. The Unified Adhan in UAE is compliant to Islamic rules and is a pioneering example across the Islamic world, he mentioned.
In a statement, Mr al Mazrouei explained that because of the time differences resulting from the vast geographical area, Awqaf had started implementing the project gradually from one region to another.
Thus Adhan was first launched there in 2005 from Madinat Zayed and its surrounding areas: Baynuna, Marfa and Liwa. In the second phase, it covered Silaa and its surroundings, Dalma Island and Ghweifat border exit. In the third and last phase, the entire Western Region, accounting for more than 1200 mosques, will be soon linked to the Unified Adhan, he said.
