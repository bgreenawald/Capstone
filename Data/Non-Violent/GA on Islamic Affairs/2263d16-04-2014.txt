Auditing operations into Awqaf's activities, procedures and initiatives of the first quarter this year has been completed. This phase precedes entering the actual results achieved in the framework of the Cabinet's performance management system (2.0).
Awqaf chairman, HE Dr Hamdan Musallam al Mazrouei, urged all departments and units to achieve the overall strategic goals, improve the working methods and be innovative in performance. He also stressed the importance of capitalising on strengths and seizing the opportunities that are conducive to further development and innovation. Auditing took one week to be completed following a scheduled plan based on RADAR approach. The latter is a benchmark tool to measure whether and to what extent various activities and programmes were implemented.  Dr al Mazrouei reiterated the importance of increasing efforts and being always keen to execute the strategic plan's activities and initiatives. This includes adopting approaches and procedures that spearhead new and modern concepts for delivering services and achieving excellence, said he.
On this occasion, he praised the continuous support Awqaf is receiving from the UAE wise leadership, and commended the active role by officials at Awqaf in putting its strategic plan into effect.
For his part, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's director general, said that Awqaf seeks to translate the  directives of the UAE leaders aiming at upgrading the Islamic Affairs' mission and vision. This is done, he said, by closely monitoring and implementing its strategic plan, which has been approved by the Cabinet. He added that auditing is essential in many ways like ensuring various programmes are accomplished, highlighting challenges, suggesting solutions and helping different departments to assess their performance and motivate them to do better.
