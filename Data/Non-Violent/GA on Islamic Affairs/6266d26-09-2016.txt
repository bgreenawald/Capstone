The UAE Official Hajj Mission examined the organisation of the UAE pilgrims travel plan in Mina and Arafat camps. The assessment is aimed at helping the pilgrims and facilitating their affairs. To this effect, the mission reviewed the detailed plan and stages related to the UAE pilgrims' travel between the holy sites to perform Hajj rites.
Commenting on the occasion, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman and Head of the UAE Official Hajj Mission, said, "The test is aimed at ensuring providing all means possible to help the pilgrims in performing the Hajj rituals in utmost comfort and peace. A specific travel route and time were defined for this purpose." He pointed out that dedicated teams were deployed to serve the camps at Mina and Arafat "round the clock."
"The teams give extra attention to serving the pilgrims at the holy sites. The coming few days will see increased efforts by all the official mission's committees to serve the pilgrims till they return to the UAE safely," Dr al Kaabi further highlighted.
"Such efforts can be summarised in implementing the travel plan in an easy manner, maintaining organisation and safety in the camps, providing emergency services, controlling food safety, cooperating with the mission's contractors with regards to contracts execution, receiving complaints and working on solving them as quickly as possible," Dr al Kaabi concluded.
