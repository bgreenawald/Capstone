The Awqaf has decided to dispatch the UAE preparatory Hajj mission to the holy places on Wednesday, Dhul Qadah 17, 1438 AH corresponding to 9/8/2017 AD, in preparation for receiving the UAE Hajj campaigns. The latter are set to start arriving at the holy sites on 21/8/2017 AD.
The mission will also receive pilgrims' camps in Mina, Arafat and Musdalifa, furnish them with all necessary equipment before the arrival of the official Hajj mission and complete all the necessary preparations, contracts processing and all other arrangements agreed upon with the competent authorities in Saudi Arabia.
The preparatory mission includes all the technical and administration cadres. It will conduct inspection visits to contractors on daily basis, the aim being to ensure receiving the camps with all their necessary facilities and services on the agreed dates prior to the arrival of Hajj campaigns.
Meanwhile, the official Hajj mission will leave to Saudi Arabia on 22/8/2017 accompanied with all its committees and sub-committees.  
In this connection, Dr Mohammad Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman and Head of the UAE Hajj mission, gave the members of the preparatory mission all instructions necessary for commencing their official duties ahead of the arrival of the UAE pilgrims to the holy sites. The aim is to provide pilgrims with the best services and touch their hearts with happiness, enabling them to perform Hajj rites in an easy and comfortable manner.
