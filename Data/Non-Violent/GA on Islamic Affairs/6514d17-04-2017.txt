In response to directives by HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE President, may Allah protect him, to relieve the brotherly people of Somalia, and in interaction with the Emirates Red Crescent's activities in this regard, Awqaf donated Dirhams one million as part of the organisation's humanitarian mission and relief efforts inside in the UAE and abroad too.
HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Chairman of Awqaf, presented a cheque with the said amount to Dr Mohammed Ateeq al Falahi, Emirates Red Crescent's secretary-general.
Commenting on the occasion, HE Dr al Kaabi said, "The UAE wise leadership's initiative 'For you Somalia' comes as the UAE marks 2017 as 'Year of Giving' for all the humanity as per directives of HH the President. It also adds to the UAE's recent classification as the world's most generous aid donor to humanitarian emergencies, enhancing thereby UAE's pioneering standing in humanitarian activities in general."
For his part, Dr al Falahi hailed the great Waqf contributions by Awqaf and the high level of coordination and cooperation between Awqaf and the Emirates Red Crescent in all the national philanthropic initiatives and the international humanitarian events.
"With such a generous donation, Awqaf becomes the first official entity responding to the ERC's campaign for the aid of the brotherly country of Somalia," Dr al Falahi concluded.
