The GAIAE's branch in Umm Al Quwain has launched recently a campaign called "Rayhanat al Janna" (Paradise fragrance) with the aim of  encouraging the community to contribute to the care of mosques by providing incense and fragrant sprays. The move also invites people to be interested in the cleanliness of houses of Allah, including their different facilities.
The branch's director, Mohammed Ibrahim Hamid, said that the programme had been announced through Friday Khutba preachers, calling upon the community members to voluntarily offer sprays, incense and tissues.
The campaign was one of many similar actions taken by Umm Al Quwain Branch in coordination with various stakeholders and school students, said Mr Hamid, adding that volunteers considered their engagement as a national duty and a community responsibility vis-à-vis houses of worship.
The campaign is complementary to the efforts of the GAIAE's branch in Umm Al Quwain in maintaining the cleanliness of mosques by providing cleaning equipment and incense for all mosques in the Emirate, he concluded.
