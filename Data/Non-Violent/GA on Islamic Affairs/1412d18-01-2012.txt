Â The General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments has raised more than AED 60 mn since it launched the Mafhas Al Qatah (Dove Nest), a fundraising  initiative aimed at building and caretaking of mosques in UAE.Mr Khaled Al Neyadi, the Executive Director of Awqaf Affairs at the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (GAIAE), said that Awqaf would organise campaigns to promote the project and publicise its goals in many of the UAE cities and emirates. The aim is to invite individuals to contribute to  the construction of houses of worship, increase people's awareness about the value of this work, as well as to encourage parents to take their children to mosques and  spread the benevolent  culture. "The launch of Mafhas Al Qatah does not mean the state is not able to build or take care of mosques by itself. In fact, the government has spared no effort to do so either in the UAE or overseas.  But it wanted to give the opportunity for  the community members to take part in this great charity work," said Mr Al Neyadi.He added that the GAIAE receives a  special support from HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahayn, the UAE President May Allah protect him, and HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice President and Prime Minister  Ruler of Dubai and from Their Highness Members of The Supreme Council, Rulers of the Emirates.On present projects, Mr Al Neyadi said  that the GAIAE had allotted AED 39 mn for the construction of six mosques, one in Umm Al Quwain at a cost of nine million and has the capacity of 1300 worshippers, one in Al Fujairah at seven million with a capacity of 1000 worshippers, one in Ras Al Khaimah at seven million and can accommodate 2100 worshippers and one in Al Ain at 12 mn with a capacity of 2100 worshippers. Two more mosques will be built  in the Western Region, each accommodates 500 worshippers with a total cost of four million. He also stressed that  the GAIAE would continue caring for and renovating mosques in accordance with the auspicious directives of the UAE leadership which devotes great interest in houses of worship and highly regards their vital role.
