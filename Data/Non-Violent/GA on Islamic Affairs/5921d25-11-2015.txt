Awqaf's Chairman, Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, and its senior officials have received HE Dr Nizar al Jeeli al Makashfi, the Sudanese Minister of State for Irshad and Awqaf (Guidance and Endowments), and the accompanying delegation at Awqaf's headoffice in Abu Dhabi.
Dr al Kaabi welcomed the Sudanese minister and lauded the deep brotherly relationship between the wise leaderships and brotherly people of the UAE and Sudan.
The visit is part of efforts to bolster cooperation and coordination in local, regional and international matters, refine the religious discourse, and contain the ideological deviations and practices by certain groups that belong to Islam but are trying to distort its true values and principles. This visit also aims to exchange mutual expertise in developing resources of endowments and ways of investment in them, as well as in fields of Fatwas, research and publications.
During the meeting, the Sudanese minister expressed his  admiration of the strategic and executive level of Awqaf's practices and its outstanding modern development, underlining the importance of exchanging experiences and visits as well as the need to promote the culture of moderation, cooperation and dialogue.
