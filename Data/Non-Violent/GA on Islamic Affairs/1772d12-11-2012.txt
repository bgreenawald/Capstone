Awqaf's chairman, HE Dr Hamdan Musallam al Mazrouei, received Ishaq Al Anba Bishoy,  Pastor of Al Anba Antonio Cathedral Church in Abu Dhabi, who came to extend his thanks to HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, in recognition for his kind congratulatory note to Anba Theodoros following the latter's enthronement as the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.
Ishaq Bishoy also congratulated Awqaf on the successful Haj season this year and stressed that the Egyptian community in general and the Coptic one in particular would like to express their sincere appreciation for the UAE leadership for the special care they receive in their stay here.
For his part, Dr al Mazrouei thanked the Pastor of Al Anba Antonio Cathedral Church in Abu Dhabi for his positive contribution in all what can enhance the culture of dialogue, tolerance and moderation. He also thanked him and the delegation accompanying him for greeting Awqaf on the occasion of Eid Al Adha and the Haj.
"We consider the letter of congratulation by HH Sheikh Khalifa, may Allah protect him, as a lesson through which we learn how to promote interfaith coexistence and respect all religious sacred places and symbols," he said.
