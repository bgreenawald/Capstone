Awqaf has announced the kickoff of the primary qualifiers for memorising Quran and Tajweed at the level of Awqaf's branches across the UAE as of April 19, 2015.
During his inauguration of the competition-related workshop, Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, Executive Director for Islamic Affairs, welcomed the attendees and thanked them for their efforts in serving the Holy Quran.
He praised the great leap made by the Holy Quran memorisation centres, which had become model centres by the grace of Allah and thanks to the continuous support by the UAE's wise leadership since they had been established by the founding leader the late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace.
"Ever since they were set up, the Holy Quran memorisation centres and sessions at mosques were expanded across the UAE and saw increasing numbers of people who are interested in enriching their knowledge," al Mazarouei added.
