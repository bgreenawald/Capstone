The Gulf Cooperation Council Forum for Endowment commences today at Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi, highlighting the approach adopted by the UAE in the field of Waqf under the umbrella of Awqaf and in accordance with well thought-out plans and strategies. The forum will also address means of achieving the ideal management of Waqf and diversification of its disbursement channels in a way to ensure commitment to the donor's will, increase its returns and meet the requirements of the needy segments of the society.
During the meeting, the convening members will learn about the history of laws and regulations governing Waqf in the UAE and its disbursement in accordance with the endower's wishes and Fiqh opinion. The forum will also discuss a draft of a new Waqf law that is set to be issued in the near future covering all rules, legal and Sharia laws regulating endowment affairs in the UAE.
On another level, the symposium will further shed light on the fourth generation of government excellence system introduced by Sheikh Khalifa Government Excellence Programme, "Shaping the Future", which is consistent with the UAE Vision 2021 that is aimed at placing the UAE amongst the world's best countries by 2021. In this regard, the convention will discuss a working paper that will address the key objective of the UAE government excellence system, which focuses on achieving the welfare and well-being of Emiratis and meeting the requirements and aspirations of the society members by offering them the highest and most effective services. Ultimately, this will boost the UAE's competitiveness and pioneering amongst the world's countries.
