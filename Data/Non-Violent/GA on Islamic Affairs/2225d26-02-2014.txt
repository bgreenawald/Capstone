The Islamic Affairs' committee headed by HE Ahmed Obeid al Mansoori have visited Awqaf's headquarters in Abu Dhabi, where they were received by HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf director general, executive directors and a host of branch and departments directors.
At the beginning of the meeting, Dr al Kaabi welcomed the committee members and lauded their visit, saying it was an impetus for further efforts to deliver better services. He then briefed them of the achievements Awqaf had made and the ongoing projects, highlighting on the occasion the keen interest and support of the wise leadership. This has great impact on upgrading our services, which meet the needs of the public, said he, adding that Awqaf had won many excellence awards.
The committee watched a documentary reviewing various achievements by Awqaf as well as its cultural, endowments and service programmes. On another note, both sides discussed plans and strategies relative to promoting endowment investment and Emiratisation.
Later they toured the UAE Official Fatwa Centre, the testing centre for selecting Imams and Muezzins and the nursery.
