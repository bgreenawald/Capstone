By virtue of its flowing generosity, the UAE affirms that the methodology of philanthropy adopted by late Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace, is still benefiting many worldwide. The principles of mercy and compassion he fostered will continue unabated in the best interest for all, Dr. Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Chairman of Awqaf, said.
"Our astute government is following suit without any discrimination in terms of gender, race, colour, country or religion. In so doing, it merely strives to please Allah and serves humanity, seeking no reward or thanks in return", he added.
Dr Al Kaabi pointed out that it had been in the nature of the UAE people to do good deeds, spend for charity and love for all.
"This is seen all over the world, and every UAE citizen is proud of what our wise leadership offers and of its approach to philanthropy that earns us the satisfaction of Allah and people," Dr al Kaabi concluded.
