In a coordination meeting, Awqaf and ADNOC Distribution discussed means whereby Awqaf to oversee ADNOC's existing mosques and those that are under construction.
The meeting was held at Awqaf's headoffice and was attended from Awqaf's side by its Chairman, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, Executive Director for Islamic Affairs, and Sultan al Niyadi, Director of Mosques Department. From ADNOC's side, it was attended by HE Abdullah Salem al Dhaheri, CEO, and Mohammed Obeid Al Dhaheri, Senior Vice President.
The two sides agreed on forming a committee that would work on integrating all ADNOC's mosques under the umbrella of Awqaf in terms of providing Imams, Khateebs, mosques lessons and lectures, furnishing and maintenance, among other services.
The meeting also discussed transforming ADNOC mosques on outside roads to host Friday prayers because travellers across UAE need places where to pray while they are on the go. ADNOC has around 59 mosques in petrol stations.
Dr al Kaabi commended on ADNOC's care about mosques and its efforts to serve the community. He also praised ADNOC's outstanding cooperation with Awqaf for the public interest.
