Awqaf urged members of the public who have accomplished Haj before not to apply again this year and the next in order to give chance for those who have not to perform pilgrimage. This comes in agreement with other Islamic countries to reduce the quota for pilgrims by 20 per cent as a result of the Mataf expansion work underway in the Grand Mosque in Mecca.
Awqaf also addressed Haj operators to respect the number of pilgrims they can accept according to The Official Haj Delegation (OHD)'s ordinances. It is worth noting that licences will be issued only to operators who have complied with the said quota.
Previously the Saudi Ministry of Haj has issued quota reduction because of the public works under way in the Mataf. It stated that it would not look into any request for increasing the number of pilgrims from Arab and Islamic countries or from those with Muslim minorities. Only after completion of the ongoing expansion projects would it review the quota, the Ministry said.
In this regard, Mr Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, director of Islamic affairs, mentioned that the OHD as well as its counterparts in other countries appreciated the efforts of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, adding that it would comply with the prescribed quota which will see the number of pilgrims from UAE drop this year from 6228 to 4982.
