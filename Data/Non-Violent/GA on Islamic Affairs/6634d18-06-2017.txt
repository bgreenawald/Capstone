This year's Programme of Scholars, guests of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, may Allah protect him, featured a new initiative under the motto "Plant Hope" that included visits to the people of determination (people with special needs) and the elderly care homes. The programme is overseen by the Ministry of Presidential Affairs and implemented by Awqaf.
The new initiative is aimed at expressing sympathy with such categories of the society, raising their spirit, strengthening their faith in the divine decree, and making them know that no illness, disability or any other no calamity befalls a Muslim, even though it were the prick he receives from a thorn, but that Allah, the Most Exalted, expiates some of their sins and raise his status in degrees because of it as long as they were true believers who show patience and acceptance of their Lord's decree.
Ultimately, those visits left in the soul of the patients and the elderly great positive effects, instilling in their minds and hearts trust in the mercy and care of Allah, the Most Gracious. The visits also promoted in them the determination to overcome desolation and worry, drawing a smile on their faces out of satisfaction and hope, seeing that they were at the centre of care by their government, community and religious scholars.
