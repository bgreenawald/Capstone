HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf Chairman, received His Eminence Mufti of Lebanon, Sheikh Abdel-Latif Derian, and his accompanying delegation. The reception was also attended by the Lebanese ambassador to the UAE, HE Hassan Yousuf Saad.
Dr al Kaabi welcomed the Mufti of Lebanon and his accompanying delegation and stressed the importance of the visit, marking cooperation and exchange of experiences between the two countries. Coordination between UAE and Lebanon includes many areas covering religious and jurisprudence affairs, Fatwa and ways of addressing violence and extremism that have plagued the entire world at this critical time.
Mufti of Lebanon and his delegation were briefed of the services that Awqaf provided to the public. They also watched a documentary film on Awqaf's achievements in accordance to the UAE wise leadership's vision and expectations.
Then Sheikh Derian together with his delegation visited the Official Fatwa Centre and listened to the explanations regarding processes of issuing Fatwa through the use of technology and other services it offered to the public inside and outside UAE.
At the end of his visit, sheikh Derian commended on what he had seen of the progress achieved saying, "truly this is an amazing example of excellence which does not exist elsewhere in the world. It is a symbol of pride that reflects the civilisation and cultural progress witnessed in UAE."
