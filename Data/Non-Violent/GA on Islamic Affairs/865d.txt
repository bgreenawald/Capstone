Waqf and Shariah  (Islamic law)
The majority of Islamic scholars agree that waqf is a shariah compliant charity. They referred to general and specific evidence.
General evidence:
Allah - Exalted be He - in His revelation said about charity, including waqf "By no means shall you attain Al-Birr (piety, righteousness - here it means Allah's reward i.e. Paradise), unless you spend in Allah's cause (al-Imran:92). The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said "When a son of Adam dies, his good deeds stop except for three things; ongoing charity, useful knowledge...".
Specific evidence:
The Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) used to establish waqf himself, and he regarded waqf as one of the best forms of charity.
Further, Ibn Umar reported that "Umar acquired land in Khaibar. He approached Prophet Mohammad(PBUH) and sought his advice in regard to it. He said to Allah's Messenger I have never acquired anything more valuable for me that this, so what do you command I do with it? Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) said: If you like you may keep the corpus intact and give its produce as Sadaqah Jariyyah (continuous charity). So Umar made Sadaqah declaring that the property must not be sold or inherited or given away. The produce to be given the poor, to the needy, to the nearest of kin, to the emancipation of slaves, to wayfarers..."Narrated in Sahih Muslim
 
Why is waqf lawful in Islam?
Waqf is a form of charity for the sake of Allah. It is lawful because it aids in the sustainable development. It also seeks to empower the Muslim society. Waqf is a beautiful loan to Allah - Exalted - Who shall reward the endower granted it is done with pure intention.
