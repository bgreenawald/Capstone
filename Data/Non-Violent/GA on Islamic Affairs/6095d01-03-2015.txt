Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, Chairman of Awqaf, met with a group of Emirati learners at Quranic centres. They are of all ages and are blessed with beautiful recitation voices.
The meeting discussed ways of honing the talents of these reciters for use in local and international competitions and recording their voices, helping them to become recites of the holy Quran worldwide, in radio and TV programmes as well as in the UAE mosques. This came as part of Awqaf's objectives to support gifted people, considering that a good recitation of Quran is a virtue that Allah, the Almighty, revealed in this Aya: "and recite the Qur'an with measured recitation."
During the meeting, Dr al Kaabi welcomed the talented students, listened to their recitation. He urged them to pay back to the wise leadership of the UAE, who sponsor creativity and creative people, and to their homeland, which is in need of them.
He instructed that talented students are eligible to receive specialised trainings and eventually be nominated for job placement. They can also pursue further higher education at the postgraduate level in Islamic studies so they can be appointed as imams, Khateebs, Preachers and Muftis.
At the end of the meeting, Dr al Kaabi gave each student a valuable in-kind gift, expressing his hope that all talented students to receive enough support in the various Holy Quran memorisation centres affiliated to all Awqaf branches across the UAE.
