The official Haj delegation (OHD)'s head, HE Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, called upon pilgrims to respect the UAE's regulations in force concerning  Haj. "Respecting rules in force is meant to avoid mistakes and ensure comfortable stay for pilgrims as per the directives of our wise leadership," He said.
He also cautioned operators to comply with all relevant decisions and the latest developments governing Haj affairs, as presented in the last expanded meeting in Dubai.
Mr al Mazrouei said that pilgrims, who would join late, cannot be accepted unless they ensure an accommodation in the Holy Sites. This decision came as a result of a recommendation by the preparatory committee, which had earlier set up and equipped the OHD offices and pilgrims' camps.
Mr al Mazrouei also urged pilgrims to certify the rent contracts in Mecca and Medina and other sites and make sure to enter the relevant data accurately in the Haj system.
