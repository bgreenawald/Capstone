 The General Authority of Islamic Affairs (GAIAE) branch in Al Ain announced that the construction of a  new mosque, a philanthropist donation, had started in the Green Mubazarrah in the Jebel Hafeet area. A land plot area of 960,2 sqm has been allocated for the mosque consisting of two floors. At completion, it will have a capacity of 650 worshippers.
Abdul Aziz Al Ghaithi, Director of  the GAIAE branch in Al Ain, said, "the allocation of a land plot for building the Maswar Mosque in the Mubazarrah area reflects the keenness of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, May Allah rest his soul, and his successor, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE president May Allah protect him, to provide this recreational place with all suitable infrastructure.
"Special interest to the site is also shown by his HH Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Mohammad Al Nahyan, the Ruler's Representative in the Eastern Region of the Abu Dhabi emirate, who is keen to ensure the necessary facilities and offer services that visitors need on the site. Mubazarrah is one of the tourist attractions in Al Ain and for this reason we find it so important to provide an appropriate prayer space for worshippers."
Mr Al Ghaiti added saying, "we have begun the construction of the mosque whose area is 880 sqm, and consists of two floors with ablution and service facilities annexed to them. It is also fitted with a lift which leads to the ladies section on the first floor that occupies 415 sqm.  The same floor also comprises the imam's house and the mosque minaret  up to 90,24 metres high. The ground floor can accommodate more than 490 worshippers, whereas the ladies section has the capacity of up to  150 worshippers."
