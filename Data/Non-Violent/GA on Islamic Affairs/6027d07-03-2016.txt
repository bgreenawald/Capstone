Thanks to the UAE wise leadership's unremitting support, Awqaf is continuing to achieve a series of impressive success in the services offered to the UAE society. According to a recent poll conducted by a specialised independent entity, Awqaf received 96 per cent of satisfaction from UAE pilgrims in 2015.
Commenting on this achievement, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, said: "through the continuous preparations round the year to follow up the Hajj and Umrah affairs in the UAE and by coordinating with the concerned authorities in Saudi Arabia, particularly during the days of Hajj, Awqaf achieved such outstanding results. A statistical survey of services and activities Awqaf performs during the Hajj season reflected the entity's keen interest in ensuring comfort for pilgrims, and this thanks to the wise leadership's support."
"The Official Hajj Mission's committees conducted 403 daily inspections and field tours of the Hajj campaigns in the holy sites. This showed an good performance this year, bringing the number of complaints to a minimum. No campaign was cancelled or suspended. Only 8 warning letters were issued year compared to 54 in 2013, and the number is in a steady decrease annually," Dr al Kaabi added.
"Based on this, the annual report made by a competent entity on this year's public satisfaction with Awqaf's services, there was high satisfaction from members of the community. Moreover, these exceptionally excellent results reflect indeed the fruits of the wise leadership's great support for the UAE pilgrims' affairs, the hard work done round the year by Awqaf's Hajj Department to reach this level of excellence, the compliance of the campaign operators with the regulations and the positive co-operation amongst Awqaf, pilgrims and campaign operators," he said.
