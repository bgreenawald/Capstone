HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, the GAIAE's Director General, has recently toured the Holy Quran memorisation centres in Fujairah. He was accompanied by Mr Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, the Executive Director for Islamic Affairs, Mr Obeid Hamad al Zaabi, the director of the GAIAE's branch in Ajman, Mr Rashid Obeid, the director of the GAIAE's branch in Fujairah, Ms Muna al Ghassani, the director of the Holy Quran memorisation centre department, in addition to heads of departments at the Fujairah's branch.
"The tour is part of a series of field visits to the Quran memorisation centres across the UAE. It is also in line with the strategic plan approved by the Cabinet that aims to sponsor young learners and upgrade the traditional Quranic schools to model ones. This is the level that the Quran memorisation centres endeavour to attain," Dr al Kaabi said.
He added: "these centres had always received full support from late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may Allah rest his soul in peace, a tradition that continues with the current leadership of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Council, The Rulers of the Emirates, and HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces."
Dr al Kaabi praised the prudent UAE leadership for their invaluable contribution and great interest in printing, distributing and encouraging the memorisation of the Holy Quran in compliance with the Hadith: "The best among you are those who learn the Qur'an and teach it."
He also mentioned that the GAIAE had developed these centres employing the best methods, learning tools and  teaching staff. "This comes in synergy with other aspects of development and progress our country is witnessing, the aim being to always maintain the Holy Quran as a beacon of guidance and integrity for all members of the community," he concluded.
