Awqaf organised a workshop on innovation for its Quran memorisation centres across the country. Conducted at the Intercontinental hotel in Abu Dhabi, the workshop was attended by Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, Awqaf's senior officials and the Quranic centres' managers, tutors and administration staff.
Inaugurating the workshop, Dr al Kaabi delivered a speech in which he extended thanks to the UAE wise leadership for its material and moral support to the holy Quran memorisation centres, the aim being to serve the Book of Allah and bring up a the Emirati boys and girls in accordance with its good manners. This also comes in framework of the moral education that the astute leadership of the UAE instructed to be introduced into the country's school curricula, added Dr al Kaabi. 
Dr al Kaabi further praised the innovative and empowering environment thrived in the UAE under the leadership of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, may Allah protect him, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and Their Highnesses the Rulers of the Emirates.
"Thus, what we need now is to innovate the best world-class practices that are conducive to serve the holy Quran. This can be achieved through brainstorming that will involve, not only the directors and tutors at the Quranic centres, but the parents of their students too," Dr al Kaabi underlined.
Dr al Kaabi called for forming a committee for innovation that will be tasked with following up the execution of innovation plans and initiatives and their outcomes. This is in line with the approach of our wise leadership in launching innovative initiatives for all the public entities, he concluded.
