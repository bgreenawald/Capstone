Awqaf's branch in the Western Region held training workshops for more than 30 members of its staff in its offices in Madinat Zayed.
Employees were divided into two categories. The first group were trained on mental and administrative skills, while the second on office management and secretarial skills. Respectively, 17 and 15 staff members benefited from these courses.
"The aim is to develop the administrative and office skills of all employees following the recruitment of many Emiratis in recent months. This makes it necessary to provide them with essential training on how to handle customer service as well as administrative procedures in a record time to meet the expectations of customers," Mr Sultan al Mazrouei, director of Awqaf's branch, said.
He added that each training session lasted three days and there would be a plan for more workshops later this year for all staff, the aim being to enhance their customer service skills.
Mr al Mazrouei explained that these workshops came to implement the directives of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, his Deputy HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Council, the Rulers of  the Emirates, and reflect the keen interest of HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and that of HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Ruler's Representative in the Western Region, in developing national human resources through continuing training programmes.
