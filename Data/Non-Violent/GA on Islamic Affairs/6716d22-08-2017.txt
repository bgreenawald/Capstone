The Martyrs' Families' Affairs Office at the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince's Court has launched a special initiative targeting 100 family members of the UAE martyrs and the injured Armed Forces personnel to perform pilgrimage for the second consecutive year.
The initiative was launched in coordination with the Awqaf and came to honour the noble sacrifices offered by their sons in the way of defending the country and preserving its achievements, as well as prevailing the word of truth. It further falls in line with the vision of the Martyrs' Families' Affairs Office in promoting social and community cohesion amongst Emiratis from all walks of life.
Commenting on the occasion, Sheikh Khalifa bin Tahnoon bin Mohammed Al Nahyan, Director of the Martyrs' Families' Affairs Office at the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince's Court, said that the initiative came in implementation of the directives of the UAE's wise leadership, which focuses on giving care to the UAE's martyrs and the injured personnel and showing appreciation of their sacrifices. He stressed the role of the Office in harnessing all capabilities and providing the necessary support to the families to perform Hajj rites this year smoothly.
For their part, the family members of the martyrs who are participating in this year's Hajj season expressed their gratitude to the UAE's astute leadership for their continued support and care. They also hailed the Martyrs' Families' Affairs Office for their role in providing all the necessary services and requirements, highlighting as well their pride of being part of this beloved homeland.
