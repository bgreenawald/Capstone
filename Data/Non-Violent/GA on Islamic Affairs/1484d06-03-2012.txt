 The GAIAE has decided to promote 331 muezzins to the position of imam as of March 1, 2012.
On this occasion, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, the GAIAE's director general, said that imams enjoy better salaries, healthcare services and other benefits compared to their counterparts in various Arab and Muslim countries.
He commended in this regard the support of HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness  Members of the Supreme Council, The Rulers of the Emirates, and HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
He added that imams also benefit from all the generous incentives provided by the prudent UAE leadership to the federal government.
"Since our mosques have become famous civilisational landmarks and a beacon of guidance, worship and education, the GAIAE follows on a daily basis the mosques' personnel affairs with the aim of improving their conditions and performance. This is through undertaking training courses to increase their skills and encourage initiatives of excellence. So the latest promotion is one more drive for continuing the excellent work and developing competence whether personal or professional" said Dr al Kaabi.
 For their part, imams, extended their gratitude to the wise leadership and the GAIAE for its efforts  to improve their living and occupational conditions.
