HE Dr Musallam al Mazrouei presided over the meeting of the committees in charge of the programme of scholars, guests of the UAE President HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, may Allah protect him.
He addressed the committees saying, " in line with the directives of HH the UAE president and the follow up of HH Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Presidential Affairs, the GAIAE will receive an elite of scholars from the Arab and Muslim world during the holy month of Ramadan. They will deliver lectures and benefit many of the community institutions, majlises and the media outlets."
He then reviewed the committees plans and directed them to meet the requests of government authorities and entities as well as companies to host lectures by HH the President's guests. He also stressed the importance of maintaining highest standards of organisation and warmly welcoming the guests.
On another note, Dr al Mazrouei praised the efforts of HH Sheikh Mansour for his keen interest in the programme and the contribution of all staff at the Ministry of Presidential affairs and their continuous monitoring of its progress.
Dr al Mazrouei also called upon the committees to choose contemporary subjects relevant to the UAE society. He suggested such themes as educating children education, achieving stability of the family, strengthening the national and social bonds,  excelling at work, renouncing radical views and extremism, fostering compassion and mercy, encouraging dialogue etiquettes and respecting the other.
With the aim of enhancing the spiritual aspects of the holy month of Ramadan and promoting the principles of moderation, he invited media outlets to seize this opportunity and conduct press interviews with HH the President's guests
