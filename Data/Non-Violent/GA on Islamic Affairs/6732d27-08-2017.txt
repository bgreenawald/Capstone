The UAE Official Hajj Mission has received the land allocated for the UAE pilgrims in Muzdalifah from the Saudi competent authorities.
HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman and Head of UAE Official Hajj Mission, said the mission's committees began immediately to prepare the land for use by dividing it into five sections to serve the pilgrims and meet their requirements easily and smoothly upon their arrival in Muzdalifah from Arafat.
As a new step this year, non-electric water spray cooling fans are set to be safely used for the convenience of pilgrims during the hot weather conditions in this year's Hajj season, Dr al Kaabi said.
Dr al Kaabi pointed out that a number of private water closets would be constructed for the first time in Muzdalifah for the private use of the UAE pilgrims and would not be shared by other pilgrims, noting that this type of services in Muzdalifah would be the first of their kind at the level of official missions and internal and external campaigns.
"Paying due attention to the UAE pilgrims is our duty and reflects our prudent leadership's directives to ensure the comfort and safety of our pilgrims", Dr al Kaabi concluded.
