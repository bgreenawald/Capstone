The Grand Mufti of the Republic of Poland, His Eminence Tomasz Miśkiewicz visited Awqaf in Abu Dhabi. The Grand Mufti was received by HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, in presence of HE Yusuf Isa Hasan al Saberi, the UAE Ambassador to Poland.
Dr al Kaabi welcomed the visitors and briefed them on the UAE's efforts aimed at instilling the approach of moderation, tolerance and peaceful co-existence amongst the constituents of the communities and civilisations.
HE Dr al Kaabi further explained the scholastic and practical procedures to combat the extremist waves and ideological deviations that are sweeping societies in the East and in the West.
During the meeting, both sides discussed ways of bolstering mutual relationships in religious, cultural and humane areas as well as coordination aimed at countering the global extremism, qualifying religious leaders, taking care of mosques and promote modern religious Fatwas. This should be conducive to nurture forbearance, moderation, civilised co-existence and multicultural communication between nations and peoples of the world. 
His Eminence the Mufti hailed the wise vision of the UAE leadership and its immense efforts aimed at promoting the brotherly relationship amongst the Islamic countries and other humane cultures. He also expressed his admiration of the great development undertaken by Awqaf in ways of achieving its mission and vision in the Arab and Islamic worlds.
