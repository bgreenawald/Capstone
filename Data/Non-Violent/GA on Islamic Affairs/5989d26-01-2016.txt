As part of its initiatives for the year 2016, Awqaf laid down a plan to organise visits to the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Centre in Abu Dhabi for all its employees. The schedule for such visits will be coordinated with the centre's management.
The higher management staff at Awqaf paid the first visit to the centre where they were briefed by its director general on the global outstanding status of the mosque in terms of its Islamic ornamentations and mission. The mosque also features the Islamic architectural style as seen around corridors, minarets, domes and yards as well as is known for its state of the art library and designs inspired by the construction patterns common throughout the Islamic civilisation stages, the director explained.
Commenting on the occasion, Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, stressed that it was necessary for all of All Awqaf's staff to get introduced to the history of mosque construction and Islamic ornamentations and their latest developments.
"The Sheikh Zayed mosque features the latest and most sophisticated Islamic artistic design elements and is considered a unique civilised edifice where the purity of its white colour unites with the Emirati environment as a testament to the vision of its founder, late Sheikh Zayed, may Allah rest his soul in peace," Dr al Kaabi added.
