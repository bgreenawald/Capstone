HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Qaabi, the GAIAE's director general, announced that the religious committee had determined  the amount of Zakat Al Fitr this year at AED 20.
The  decision came following a meeting of the said committee held on June 7, 2012 and  chaired by Dr Farouq Hamada, the religious advisor at the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince's Court.
To specify the exact amount, the committee measured the Zakat based on 2040 g of rice, being the most common staple food in the country, and monitored its price in many cooperative society stores and local shopping centres. It found that the average price of the legal amount of Zakat this year is AED 20.
