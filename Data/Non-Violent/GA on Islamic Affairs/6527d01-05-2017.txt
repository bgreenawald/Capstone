Starting from this season, Hajj permits would be granted only to Emiratis, according to an announcement by the Awqaf. In a circulation about the move, Awqaf instructed the accredited Hajj operators across the UAE not to grant permits to non-Emirati applicants.  
In its circulation, Awqaf expressed its regret that it would not be able to grant Hajj permits to residents to perform Hajj, neither this year nor in the future. It explained that the decision was in line with instructions from the ministry of Hajj in Saudi Arabia and based on agreements between the ministry and a UAE delegation of Hajj affairs for the year 1438 AH.
The announcement further highlighted that UAE's quota for this year's season is 6,228 permits for Emirati pilgrims.
