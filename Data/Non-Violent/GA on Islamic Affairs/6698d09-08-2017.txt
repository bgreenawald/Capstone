Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, emphasised that the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan has instilled deeply in the minds and hearts of generations the character of the founding leader and that Zayed and the nation are firmly associated. As such, whenever Zayed's name is mentioned the homeland will be definitely mentioned too. This is because late Sheikh Zayed, may Allah rest his soul in peace, is alive in the conscience of each male and female Emirati as a symbol of the eternal love in the UAE, Dr al Kaabi explained.
Concluding his statement, Dr al Kaabi pointed out that Zayed represents the spirit of the Union that keeps flowing in the veins of the nation, the community and the generations for, indeed, the edifices he established are very high.
