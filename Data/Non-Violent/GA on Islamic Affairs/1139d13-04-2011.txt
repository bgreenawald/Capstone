Mr.Mohammed Obeid AlMazrouei, GAIAE executive director for Islamic affaris, said that GAIAE has upgraded and modernized the electronic system of the Quran memorization centers. The upgraded system offers a variety of functions, instructions and information. It provides the user with complete information on the centers, courses, teachers, students and administration.
On the other hand, the electronic system provides ample and accurate information on private and endowment Quran memorization centers, as well as mosque Quran teaching sessions. This allows GAIAE to accelerate processing off the centers' requests.
Mr.AlMazrouei added that GAIAE is also working on improving Quran memorization methodology, in addition to training and supervising the teachers to reach highly quality performance. Moreover , GAIAE has organized Quran memorization contests aimed at fostering new generation's Â interest in the Holy book and inciting them to compete.
GAIAE is eager to guide Muslim youth to be among the people of the Holy Book, those who recite its words and apply its rulings in their daily life. Its goal is to infuse the spirit of love for the Glorious Quran as Prophet Muhammad, may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: 'The best of you is the one who learns the Quran and teaches it.'
New Quran memorization centers were inaugurated in most areas in the UAE. Both private and endowment based centers accept students of all ages throughout the year. Moreover, mosques offer two Quran memorization sessions a year. GAIAE is keen to meet the needs of all institutions seeking highly qualified Quran teachers for its employees.
