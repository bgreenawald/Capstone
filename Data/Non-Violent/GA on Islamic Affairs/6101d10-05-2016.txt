HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, received at Awqaf's headquarters in Abu Dhabi HE Hussain Baqees, the Indonesian Ambassador to the UAE, and the accompanying delegation. Present at the meeting were executive directors and senior officials of Awqaf.
Dr al Kaabi welcomed the delegation members, who came to learn about Awqaf's experience in religious affairs. He also thanked them for the kind visit and praised the deep brotherly relations between the leaderships and the people of the UAE and the Republic of Indonesia.
Dr al Kaabi briefed the visitors on Awqaf's organisational structure and the approach it adopts to convey its message to the society. He underscored the great support to Awqaf by the UAE's wise leadership and its vision in reflecting the bright image of Islam, uncovering the thoughts that are alien to it, instilling the principles of moderation and forbearance as well as combating extremism and promoting the values of tolerance and peaceful co-existence amongst people.
Discussions also addressed means of fostering cooperation and exchanging expertise between both sides.
As part of the visit, the Indonesian Ambassador toured the Official Fatwa Centre where he was briefed on its services offered to the public, both inside and outside the UAE. He also learned about the approach followed by the centre in answering the public's queries through the toll-free- number, SMS and Awqaf's website, which provides the service in Arabic, English and Urdu.
The ambassador expressed his delight with the advanced level achieved by Awqaf, highlighting his admiration of its sophisticated approach in making use of the best means to serve its objectives. He also commended on the peaceful co-existence between religions characterising the UAE society and the respect enjoyed by all the residents regardless of their nationalities.
