Awqaf and the management of the Ministry of Interior's Faraj Fund signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to organise a campaign to raise aid for the inmates of the Punitive and Correctional Establishments, and their families across the UAE.
Under the MoU the inmates will get aid to settle their financial liabilities, debts or blood money. For the first time, the MoU will include the inmates' families as a primary category that is eligible in the donation programmes carried out by Awqaf. Such donations, will, then, be offered to the families through the Faraj Fund, the aim being to extend a helping hand to them in meeting their daily life needs.
Commenting on the occasion, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, said that Awqaf's board of directors allocated an amount of AED 1.5 million for supporting the beneficiaries of the MOI's Faraj Fund. The said amount will be dedicated for paying off the debts of indigent prisoners. This will be done in accordance with the goals and objectives of the Fund, Dr al Kaabi added.
Dr al Kaabi pointed out that the initiative comes in line with Awqaf's social participation policy, which is aimed at bolstering means of cooperation and coordination between Awqaf and such entities that are concerned with the public interest and charitable work. He further stressed that Awqaf's board is keenly interested in making such donation an annual practice and paying it in one lot to the Fund's management.  
Established in 2009, the Faraj Fund works, as one of the UAE's charitable institutions, on promoting the values of social solidarity and compassion, endorsing the modern concepts of penal reform and ensuring a decent life for the inmates' family and dependents by offering them financial aid till the inmates reunite with their families. It also seeks to help in paying the indigent inmates' debts so that they can be released from prison.
