 The General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments (GAIAE) last Sunday formed a special  committee to look into grievances filed by pilgrims against Haj campaigns, which took part in last year's Haj season. Sanctions against those who are found guilty of violating the regulations stipulated by the Awqaf Authority will be announced by next Sunday. The GAIAE received 26 complaints during the month it set for this purpose.
Mr. Obeid Mohammed Al Zaabi, Director of the Hajj and Umra Department said that the current  number of Haj campaigns amounts to 146, noting that  the deadline of receiving complaints was over. Mr. Al Zaabi added that 15 complaints were made by pilgrims whilst the official mission was  onsite. But this number rose up to 26 as another 11 complaints were filed  following the official announcement by the GAIAE to receive grievances.
