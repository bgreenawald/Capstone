In a regular meeting with Imams, Khateebs (preachers), Muezzins and staff members of the GAIAE's branch in Ajman and Umm Al Quwain, which was held at the theatre of the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Community Development in Abu Dhabi, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, the GAIAE' General Director, said that loyalty to the nation and its wise leadership is one of the most important  religious duties.
On this occasion, he implored Allah, The Most Exalted, to perpetuate the grace of good health and happiness for HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President, may Allah protect him, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, Their Highness Members of the Supreme Council, and HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces.
Dr al Kaabi underscored the fact that the blessings of welfare, security and social stability that the UAE is enjoying are first and foremost a grace from Allah the Almighty, Who has brought to fruition the relentless efforts invested by the prudent UAE leaders. He mentioned that this had brought about a comprehensive development, one that foresees the future and lay down the sustainable means for continuous progress and prosperity. These are the true and practical values that we should embrace and promote in our community, he concluded.
