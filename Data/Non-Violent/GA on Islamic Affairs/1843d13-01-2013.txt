In support of the "Thank You" campaign Awqaf honoured on Tuesday mosque general service workers in Abu Dhabi and other Awqaf branches all over the UAE. 
The ceremony was held in Abu Dhabi and attended by HE Dr Hamdan Musallam al Mazrouei, Awqaf's chairman, HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's director general, along with Awqaf's executive directors.
In his speech, Dr al Mazrouei stressed that the UAE wise leadership appreciates all efforts that contribute to the nation-building and the provision of best services in various development projects. In this process one of the most important services is taking care of mosques for its special religious and social value appreciated by all, he said.
HE also highlighted the important role of trustworthy workers, mentioning that the more dedicated and loyal they are the more appreciation and respect they will receive from employers and community institutions.
For his part, Dr al Kaabi thanked cleaning and maintenance workers in mosques and reminded them of their important role in serving the houses of Allah. He said that everyone from different levels, grades and titles makes up one successful working team as long as he is aware of his responsibilities, does his job and respects the laws and regulations in force. Everyone shall therefore receive due respect for complying with this, he added.
Speeches were translated into languages spoken by workers, after which Dr al Mazrouei, Dr al Kaabi along with other executive directors joined the gathering for breakfast and photo taking. On this occasion, workers expressed their joy and thanked the wise leadership and the community institutions behind this kind initiative.
