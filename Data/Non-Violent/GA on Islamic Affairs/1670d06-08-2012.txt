The scholars, guests of HH the President, praised the special interest of the wise UAE leadership in Waqf and its development as well as the actions aiming at raising people's awareness of its goals and role in society.
The GAIAE is undertaking campaigns to involve all segments of society to contribute to Waqf disbursements and revive this invaluable tradition.
During their daily schedule of lectures supervised by the Ministry of Presidential Affairs and organised by the GAIAE, lecturers explained that the Waqf is an act of charity that benefits both the donor and the beneficiary groups and the community at large.
A charitable act of great importance, the Waqf is an old practice that helps ensure economic development for people and the country. In Islam, anyone who seeks to do good and benefits people will be recompensed as much as his quest.
Sheikh Ali Kuti Musliyar, the principal of Nooriya Arabiyya University, discussed the continuity of the reward obtained from the Waqf even after the death of the donor, explaining that the Waqf is one of the most important acts of ongoing charities besides planting trees,  digging wells, flowing streams of water, among others. He also said that the companions of the Prophet (may Allah be pleased with them) used to compete for investing their wealth in Waqf projects whose revenues went to serve various segments of the community.
For his part, sheikh Salah al Dine al Mastawi considered the Waqf as an embodiment of compassion, solidarity and charity amongst Muslims, saying that endowments have played a great role in establishing many civilisational landmarks that people still get benefit from today. He therefore called on people to follow in the footsteps of the righteous predecessors and donate generously.
