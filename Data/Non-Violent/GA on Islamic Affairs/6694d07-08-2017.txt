In coordination and collaboration with the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention, Awqaf invited the physicians who will accompany Hajj campaigns for this year's season to attend an awareness workshop on Hajj affair, disease prevention and other healthcare requirements in the holy places. The workshop will be held at the Ministry of Health's auditorium in Dubai on Thursday, 10/8/2017, at 10:00am.
Commenting on the occasion, Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman and Head of the UAE Official Hajj Mission, hailed the support to the mission by the UAE astute leadership, providing it with the state-of-the-art technical, medical and service equipment. The aim is to touch the pilgrims' hearts with happiness and enable the mission to deliver the highest services to them, he added.
