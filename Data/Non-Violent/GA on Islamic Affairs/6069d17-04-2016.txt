In line with its Cabinet-approved strategic plan, Awqaf has signed two contracts for the construction of three mosques which will be funded by the Red Crescent Authority. The project received a substantial support from HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Ruler's Representative in the Western Region and Chairman of the RCA.
Awqaf will implement, according with its plans, the project in coordination with the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council. It came to keep in pace with the comprehensive urban progress witnessed in the Western Region in Abu Dhabi.
The mosques will be built in Zayed city, Al Selaa and Al Mirfa following a master planning that respects the heritage of the area. Each mosque will be designed to accommodate up to 400 worshippers and the construction work is set to be completed in the first quarter of 2017.
