Following an Islamic tradition of important social significance, the GAIAE bought 10,000 cloaks for free distribution to imams, preachers and muezzins. Each of them will get two pieces. The move reflects the keenness of the GAIAE to see this segment of society observe a presentable standard in style and attire in compliance with the Quranic verse: "O children of Adam, take your adornment at every masjid." (Al Aaraf:31).
" The neat appearance  of imams, preachers and muezzins should be distinct, formal and commensurate with the religious, social and environmental  status in the UAE. It is by the grace of Allah, The Exalted be He, and due to the continuing support from the UAE prudent leadership, that imams enjoy special care. Indeed, mosques, including those who  maintained them, are at the centre of a great civilisation that mark  our daily lives," HE Dr Mohammed Matar Al Kaabi, the GAIAE's director General, said.
