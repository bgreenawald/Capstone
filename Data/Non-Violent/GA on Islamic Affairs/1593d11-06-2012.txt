The Waqf investment committee has recently met to look into the working procedures for rebuilding the old Sheikh Zayed Waqf in Khalidiya, Abu Dhabi, which was pulled down last year. After completion the new building will be the largest endowment in UAE.
The  meeting was presided over by HE Dr Hamdan Musallam al Mazrouei, the GAIAE's chairman, and attended by HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, the GAIAE's director general, Mr Khaled al Neyadi, the executive director of Waqf affairs , in addition to the engineers, members of the committee.
"Established by Sheikh Zayed, may Allah rest his soul in peace, in 1975, this  Waqf is the largest commercial and residential endowment in UAE. It was demolished last year with the aim of replacing it with a new building at an estimated cost of AED 324,8 mn... Construction work will start next month," said Dr al Kaabi.
The new tower will sit on an area of about 1025 sqm, and consist of five basement levels for car parking, a ground floor for showrooms, a mezzanine for offices in addition to 29 storeys for residential purposes.  Construction work will take 26 months and at completion the project is estimated  to generate about AED 45 mn per year, being the highest annual Waqf revenue.
The Waqf committee also discussed the work progress in other projects in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Fujairah, Al Ain and the Western Region, where several buildings and shopping centres are under construction.
