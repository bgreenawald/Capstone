HE Dr Mohammed Matar al Kaabi, the GAIAE's Director General, inaugurated a new Mosque in Al Maria Al Gharbiya in Liwa. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Mr Mohammed Obeid al Mazrouei, the Executive Director for Islamic Affairs, and Mr Sultan Zayed al Mazrouei, the director of the GAIAE's branch in the Western Region as well as a large number of residents from Liwa.
Named after its benefactor,  Mr Ahmed Mohammed Mahoush al Mazrouei, the new mosque features a combination of Andalusian and modern architectural elements, and has a space for more than 500 worshippers. It is fitted with all necessary facilities, including a female prayer room and an accommodation for the Imam. It is also furnished with fine carpets and is linked to the unified Adhan system.
Dr al Kaabi hailed the role of the wise UAE leadership for its initiatives for building and maintaining the houses of Allah and the generous donations offered by Emirati philanthropists. On the occasion, he honoured Mr Ahmed Al Mazrouei, and emphasised that the GAIAE's is keen to continue building mosques in consistency with the modern urban development and the distribution of population. Six mosques  have already been opened in the Western Region during the last six months.
Dr al Kaabi further explained that the opening of this mosque is part of a plan to build more mosques in the Western Region in line with the comprehensive urban development in the Western Region, which has been laid down by HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE President. This programme receives a full support from HH General Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces, and a close follow up of HH Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Representative of the Ruler in the Western Region.
