The UAE and all citizens and residents who are living in our beloved, stable and prosperous homeland are cherishing one of the finest examples of a happy life that is rich in its human diversity, said Dr Mohammad Matar al Kaabi, Awqaf's Chairman, in a statement marking the International Day for Tolerance.
Dr al Kaabi further hailed the culture of respect that is deeply rooted in the UAE towards the cultural and religious diversity of all the people who enter the country, whether for work, tourism or business. Such tolerance is also embraced towards all economic, educational and humanitarian institutions existing the UAE, those being supporting elements that are conducive to enrich the country's growth, Dr al Kaabi added.
"The UAE wise leadership nurtures such diverse social fabric and our religion provides it with an ideal environment to flourish based on the values of constructive co-existence amongst different nationalities. Indeed, cultural exchange is key to building civilisations. Moreover, life will not develop or prosper except through making best use of all the human repository of innovation and ambitions," Dr al Kaabi further highlighted.   
Dr al Kaabi concluded his statements by calling for "embracing tolerance as the most prominent principles of the noble human civilisation that we are all seeking to build, one that is consistent with the teachings of our religion."
